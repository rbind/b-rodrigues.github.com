<p><em>Warning: I highly recommend you read this <a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2023-07-19-nix_for_r_part2/">blog
post</a> first, which
will explain how to run a pipeline inside Nix in detail. This blog post will
assume that you’ve read that one, and it would also help if you’re familiar with
Github Actions, if not, read this <a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2022-11-19-raps/">other blog post of mine as
well</a></em></p>
<p>This is getting ridiculous. The meme that I’m using as a header for this blog
post perfectly summaries how I feel.</p>
<p>This will be a short blog post, because Nix makes things so easy that there’s
not much to say. I wanted to try how I could use Nix on Github Actions to run a
reproducible pipeline. This pipeline downloads some data, prepares it, and fits
a machine learning model. It is code that I had laying around from an old video
on the now deprecated <code>{drake}</code> package, <code>{targets}</code> predecessor.</p>
<p>You can find the pipeline
<a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nix_ml_cicd_demo/tree/main">here</a>
and you can also take a look at the same pipeline but which uses Docker
<a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/mlops_demo">here</a>
for comparison purposes.</p>
<p>What I wanted to achieve was the following: I wanted to set up a reproducible
environment with Nix on my computer, work on my pipeline locally, and then have
it run on Github Actions as well. But I wanted my pipeline to run exactly on the
same environment as the one I was using to develop it. In a world without Nix,
this means using a mix of <code>{renv}</code> (or <code>{groundhog}</code> or <code>{rang}</code>) and a Docker
image that ships the right version of R. I would then need to write a Github
Actions workflow file that builds that Docker image, then runs it and saves the
outputs as artifacts. Also, in practice that image would not be exactly the same
as my local environment: I would have the same version of R and R packages, but
every other system-level dependency would be a different version unless I use
that Dockerized environment to develop locally, something I suggested you should
do merely <a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2023-05-08-dock_dev_env/">4 months
ago</a> (oooh, how blind
was I!).</p>
<p>With Nix, not only can I take care of the version of R and R packages with one
single tool but also every underlying system-level dependency gets handled by
Nix. So if I use a package that requires, say, Java, or GDAL, or any other of
these usual suspects that make installing their R bindings so tricky, Nix will
handle this for me without any intervention on my part. I can also use this
environment to develop locally, and then, once I’m done working locally,
<em>exactly</em> this environment, <em>exactly</em> every bit of that environment, will get
rebuilt and used to run my code on Github Actions.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nix_ml_cicd_demo">this is the repository</a>
where you can find the code. There’s a <code>{targets}</code> script that defines the
pipeline and a <code>functions/</code> folder with some code that I wrote for said
pipeline. What’s unfamiliar to you (unless you’ve been reading my Nix adventures
since the beginning) is the <code>default.nix</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>let
 pkgs = import (fetchTarball &quot;https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/976fa3369d722e76f37c77493d99829540d43845.tar.gz&quot;) {};
 rpkgs = builtins.attrValues {
  inherit (pkgs.rPackages) tidymodels vetiver targets xgboost;
};
 system_packages = builtins.attrValues {
  inherit (pkgs) R;
};
in
 pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [  rpkgs system_packages  ];
 }</code></pre>
<p>This few lines of code define an environment that pulls packages from revision
<code>976fa3369d722e76f37c77493d99829540d43845</code> of <code>nixpkgs</code>. It installs the
packages <code>{tidymodels}</code>, <code>{vetiver}</code>, <code>{targets}</code> and <code>{xgboost}</code> (actually, I’m
not using <code>{vetiver}</code> for this <em>yet</em>, so it could even be removed). Then it also
installs R. Because we’re using that specific revision of Nix, exactly the same
packages (and their dependencies) will get installed, regardless of when we
build this environment. I want to insist that this file is 12 lines long and it
defines a complete environment. The equivalent <code>Dockerfile</code> is much longer, and
not even completely reproducible, and I would have needed external tools like
<code>{renv}</code> (or use the Posit CRAN mirror dated snapshots) as you can check out
<a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/mlops_demo">here</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s now turn our attention to the workflow file:</p>

<p>The workflow file above is heavily inspired from the one you get when you run
<code>targets::tar_github_actions()</code>. Running this puts the following
<a href="https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/22103e19584ea15ae44328c07bc9d2699b004a47/inst/templates/github_actions.yaml">file</a>
on the root of your <code>{targets}</code> project. This file is a Github Actions workflow
file, which means that each time you push your code on Github, the pipeline will
run in the cloud. However it needs you to use <code>{renv}</code> with the project so that
the right packages get installed. You’ll also see a step called <code>Install Linux dependencies</code> which you will have to adapt to your project.</p>
<p>All of this can be skipped when using Nix. All that must be done is installing
Nix itself, using the <code>nix-installer-action</code> from Determinate Systems, then
using the <code>magic-nix-cache-action</code> which caches the downloaded packages so we
don’t need to wait for the environment to build each time we push (unless we
changed the environment of course) and that’s about it. We then build the
environment on Github Actions using <code>nix-build</code> and then run the pipeline using
<code>nix-shell default.nix --run "Rscript -e 'targets::tar_make()'"</code>. All the other
steps are copied almost verbatim from the linked file above and make sure that
the computed targets only get recomputed if I edit anything that impacts them,
and also that they get pushed into a branch called <code>targets-runs</code>. I say <em>copied
almost verbatim</em> because some steps must run inside R, so we need to specify
that we want to use the R that is available through the Nix environment we just
built.</p>
<p>Now, each time we push, the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>if we didn’t change anything to <code>default.nix</code>, the environment gets retrieved from the cache. If we did change something, then environment gets rebuilt (or rather, only the parts that need to be rebuilt, the rest will still get retrieved from the cache)</li>
<li>if we didn’t change anything to the <code>_targets.R</code> pipeline itself, then every target will get skipped. If not, only the targets that need to get recomputed will get recomputed.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last thing that I didn’t mention: on line 9 you’ll see this:</p>
<pre><code>runs-on: ubuntu-latest</code></pre>
<p>this means that the Github Actions will run on the latest available version of
Ubuntu, which is obviously not fixed. When the next LTS gets released in April
2024, this pipeline will be running on Ubuntu 24.04 instead of the current LTS,
version 22.04. This is not good practice because we don’t want the underlying
operating system to be changing, because this could have an impact on the
reproducibility of our pipeline. But with Nix, this <strong>does not matter</strong>.
Remember that we are using a specific revision of <code>nixpkgs</code> for our pipeline, so
the <em>exact</em> same version of not only R and R packages gets installed, but every
underlying piece of software that needs to be available will be installed as
well. We could be running this in 50 years on Ubuntu LTS 74.04 and it would
still install the same stuff and run the same code and produce exactly the same
results.</p>
<p>This is really bonkers.</p>
<p>Nix is an incredibly powerful tool. I’ve been exploring and using it for 3
months now, but if something impresses me more than how useful it is, is how
terribly unknown it still is. I hope that this series of blog posts will
motivate other people to learn it.</p>
