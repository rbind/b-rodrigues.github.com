</div>
<p>This is the first of a (hopefully) series of posts about Nix. Disclaimer: I’m a
super beginner with Nix. So this series of blog posts is more akin to notes that
I’m taking while learning than a super detailed tutorial. So if you’re a Nix
expert and read something stupid in here, that’s normal. This post is going to
focus on R (obviously) but the ideas are applicable to any programming language.</p>
<p>To ensure that a project is reproducible you need to deal with at least four
things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that the required/correct version of R (or any other language) is installed;</li>
<li>Make sure that the required versions of packages are installed;</li>
<li>Make sure that system dependencies are installed (for example, you’d need a working Java installation to install the <code>{rJava}</code> R package on Linux);</li>
<li>Make sure that you can install all of this for the hardware you have on hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the three first bullet points, the consensus seems to be a mixture of Docker
to deal with system dependencies, <code>{renv}</code> for the packages (or <code>{groundhog}</code>,
or a fixed CRAN snapshot like those <a href="https://packagemanager.posit.co/__docs__/user/get-repo-url/#ui-frozen-urls">Posit
provides</a>)
and the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/rig">R installation manager</a> to install the
correct version of R (unless you use a Docker image as base that already ships
the required version by default). As for the last point, the only way out is to
be able to compile the software for the target architecture. There’s a lot of
moving pieces, and knowledge that you need to know and I even wrote a whole 522
pages <a href="https://raps-with-r.dev/">book about all of this</a>.</p>
<p>But it turns out that this is not the only solution. Docker + <code>{renv}</code> (or some
other way to deal with packages) is likely the most popular way to ensure
reproducibility of your projects, but there are other tools to achieve this. One
such tool is called Nix.</p>
<p>Nix is a package manager for Linux distributions, macOS and apparently it even
works on Windows if you enable WSL2. What’s a package manager? If you’re not a
Linux user, you may not be aware. Let me explain it this way: in R, if you want
to install a package to provide some functionality not included with a vanilla
installation of R, you’d run this:</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>It turns out that Linux distributions, like Ubuntu for example, work in a
similar way, but for software that you’d usually install using an installer (at
least on Windows). For example you could install Firefox on Ubuntu using:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install firefox</code></pre>
<p>(there’s also graphical interfaces that make this process “more user-friendly”).
In Linux jargon, <code>packages</code> are simply what normies call software (or I guess
it’s all “apps” these days). These packages get downloaded from so-called
repositories (think of CRAN, the repository of R packages) but for any type of
software that you might need to make your computer work: web browsers, office
suites, multimedia software and so on.</p>
<p>So Nix is just another package manager that you can use to install software.</p>
<p>But what interests us is not using Nix to install Firefox, but instead to
install R and the R packages that we require for our analysis (or any other
programming language that we need). But why use Nix instead of the usual ways to
install software on our operating systems?</p>
<p>The first thing that you should know is that Nix’s repository, <code>nixpkgs</code>, is
huge. Humongously huge. As I’m writing these lines, <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages">there’s more than 80’000
pieces of software available</a>, and the
<em>entirety of CRAN</em> is also available through <code>nixpkgs</code>. So instead of installing
R as you usually do and then use <code>install.packages()</code> to install packages, you
could use Nix to handle everything. But still, why use Nix at all?</p>
<p>Nix has an interesting feature: using Nix, it is possible to install software in
(relatively) isolated environments. So using Nix, you can install as many
versions of R and R packages that you need. Suppose that you start working on a
new project. As you start the project, with Nix, you would install a
project-specific version of R and R packages that you would only use for that
particular project. If you switch projects, you’d switch versions of R and R
packages. If you are familiar with <code>{renv}</code>, you should see that this is exactly
the same thing: the difference is that not only will you have a project-specific
library of R packages, you will also have a project-specific R version. So if
you start a project now, you’d have R version 4.2.3 installed (the latest
version available in <code>nixpkgs</code> but not the latest version available, more on
this later), with the accompagnying versions of R packages, for as long as the
project lives (which can be a long time). If you start a project next year, then
that project will have its own R, maybe R version 4.4.2 or something like that,
and the set of required R packages that would be current at that time. This is
because Nix always installs the software that you need in separate, (isolated)
environments on your computer. So you can define an environment for one specific
project.</p>
<p>But Nix even goes even further: not only can you install R and R packages using
Nix (in isolated) project-specific environments, Nix even installs the required
system dependencies. So for example if I need <code>{rJava}</code>, Nix will make sure to
install the correct version of Java as well, always in that project-specific
environment (so if you already some Java version installed on your system, there
won’t be any interference).</p>
<p>What’s also pretty awesome, is that you can use a specific version of <code>nixpkgs</code>
to <em>always</em> get <em>exactly</em> the same versions of <strong>all</strong> the software whenever you
build that environment to run your project’s code. The environment gets defined
in a simple plain-text file, and anyone using that file to build the environment
will get exactly, byte by byte, the same environment as you when you initially
started the project. And this also regardless of the operating system that is
used.</p>
<p>So let me illustrate this. After <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/install-nix">installing
Nix</a>, I can define an environment by
writing a file called <code>default.nix</code> that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>{ pkgs ? import (fetchTarball &quot;https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/e11142026e2cef35ea52c9205703823df225c947.tar.gz&quot;) {} }:

with pkgs;

let
  my-pkgs = rWrapper.override {
    packages = with rPackages; [ dplyr ggplot2 R];
  };
in
mkShell {
  buildInputs = [my-pkgs];
}</code></pre>
<p>Now this certainly looks complicated! And it is. The entry cost to Nix is quite
high, because, actually, Nix is more than a package manager. It is also a
programming language, and this programming language gets used to configure
environments. I won’t go too much into detail, but you’ll see in the first line
that I’m using a specific version of <code>nixpkgs</code> that gets downloaded directly
from Github. This means that all the software that I will install with that
specific version of <code>nixpkgs</code> will always install the same software. This is
what ensures that R and R packages are versioned. Basically, by using a specific
version of <code>nixpkgs</code>, I pin all the versions of all the software that this
particular version of Nix will <em>ever</em> install. I then define a variable called
<code>my-pkgs</code> which lists the packages I want to install (<code>{dplyr}</code>, <code>{ggplot2}</code> and
<code>R</code>).</p>
<p>By the way, this may look like it would take a lot of time to install because,
after all, you need to install R, R packages and underlying system dependencies,
but thankfully there is an online cache of binaries that gets automatically used
by Nix (<a href="https://cache.nixos.org/">cache.nixos.org</a>) for fast installations. If
binaries are not available, sources get compiled.</p>
<p>I can now create an environment with these exact specifications using (in the
directory where <code>default.nix</code> is):</p>
<pre><code>nix-build</code></pre>
<p>or I could use the R version from this environment to run some arbitrary code:</p>
<pre><code>nix-shell /home/renv/default.nix --run &quot;Rscript -e &#39;sessionInfo()&#39;&quot; &gt;&gt; /home/renv/sessionInfo.txt</code></pre>
<p>(assuming my <code>default.nix</code> file is available in the <code>/home/renv/</code> directory).
This would build the environment on the fly and run <code>sessionInfo()</code> inside of
it. Here are the contents of this <code>sessionInfo.txt</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15)
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

Matrix products: default
BLAS/LAPACK: /nix/store/pbfs53rcnrzgjiaajf7xvwrfqq385ykv-blas-3/lib/libblas.so.3

locale:
[1] C

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     

loaded via a namespace (and not attached):
[1] compiler_4.2.3</code></pre>
<p>This looks like any other output of the <code>sessionInfo()</code> function, but there is
something quite unusual: the <code>BLAS/LAPACK</code> line:</p>
<pre><code>BLAS/LAPACK: /nix/store/pbfs53rcnrzgjiaajf7xvwrfqq385ykv-blas-3/lib/libblas.so.3</code></pre>
<p>BLAS is a library that R uses for linear algebra, matrix multiplication and
vector operations. R usually ships with its own version of BLAS and LAPACK, but
it’s also possible to use external ones. Here, we see that the path to the
shared object <code>libblas.so.3</code> is somewhere in <code>/nix/store/....</code>. <code>/nix/store/</code> is
where all the software gets installed. The long chain of seemingly random
characters is a hash, essentially the unique identifier of that particular
version of BLAS. This means that unlike Docker, if you’re using Nix you are also
certain than these types of dependencies, that may have an impact on your
results, also get handled properly, and that the exact same version you used
will keep getting installed in the future. Docker images also evolve, and even
if you use an LTS release of Ubuntu as a base, the underlying system packages
will evolve through time as well. And there will be a point in time where this
release will be abandoned (LTS releases receive 5 years of support), so if you
need to rebuild a Docker images based on an LTS that doesn’t get supported
anymore, you’re out of luck.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to install Nix just yet on your computer, you should know that
there’s also a complete operating system called NixOS, that uses Nix as its
package manager, and that there are Docker images that use NixOS as a base. So
this means that you could use such an image and then build the environment (that
is 100% completely reproducible) inside and run a container that will always
produce the same output. To see an example of this, check out this <a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nix_experiments/tree/master">Github
repo</a>. I’m writing a
Dockerfile as I usually do, but actually I could even use Nix to define the
Docker image for me, it’s that powerful!</p>
<p>Nix seems like a very powerful tool to me. But there are some “issues”:</p>
<ul>
<li>As I stated above, the entry cost is quite high, because Nix is not “just a tool”, it’s a complete programming language that can even run pipelines, so you could technically even replace something like <code>{targets}</code> with it;</li>
<li>If you need to install specific versions of R packages, that are not pinned to dates, then Nix is not for you. Nix will always create a coherent environment with R and R packages that go together for a particular release of <code>nixpkgs</code>. If for some reason you need a very old version of <code>{ggplot2}</code> but a much more recent version of <code>{dplyr}</code>, using Nix won’t make this any easier than other methods;</li>
<li>There is no easy way (afaik) to find the version of <code>nixpkgs</code> that you need to download to find the version of R that you may need; <strong>UPDATE</strong>: turns out that there is such a <a href="https://lazamar.co.uk/nix-versions/?channel=nixpkgs-unstable&amp;package=r">simple tool</a>, thanks to <span class="citation">@shane</span><span class="citation">@hachyderm.io</span> for the telling me!</li>
<li>R packages (and I guess others for other programming languages as well) that are available on the stable channel of <code>nixpkgs</code> lag a bit behind their counterparts on CRAN. These usually all get updated whenever there’s a new release of R. Currently however, R is at version 4.2.3, but R should be at version 4.3.1 on the stable branch of <code>nixpkgs</code>. This can sometimes happen due to various reasons (there are actual human beings behind this that volunteer their time and they also have a life). There is however an “unstable” <code>nixpkgs</code> channel that contains bleeding edge versions of R packages (and R itself) if you really need the latest versions of packages (don’t worry about the “unstable” label, from my understanding this simply means that package have not been thoroughly tested yet, but is still pretty much rock-solid);</li>
<li>If you need something that is not on CRAN (or Bioconductor) then it’s still possible to use Nix to install these packages, but you’ll have to perform some manual configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will keep exploring Nix, and this is essentially my todo:</p>
<ul>
<li>using my environment that I installed with Nix to work interactively;</li>
<li>write some tool that lets me specify an R version, a list of packages and it generates a <code>default.nix</code> file automagically (ideally it should also deal with packages only available on Github);</li>
<li>????</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
