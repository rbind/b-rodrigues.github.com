<p>Foreword: This is not a tutorial nor anything like that. I’m going to talk about free software,
open source, and their licenses. I’m going to give my (non-)expert opinion on it. You may find,
after having finished reading this post, that I wasted your time. So only read if by some miracle
the first sentence of the foreword excited you. If not, close this tab and go back now. It’s not
too late.</p>
<p>Foreword 2: I’ve updated the post on October 24th with an additional meme, clarifications and a link
to an interesting stackexchange discussion.</p>
<div id="free-software-aint-free" class="section level2">
<h2>Free software ain’t free</h2>
<p>Let me first re-iterate that free software and open source are not the same thing. Free software is
open source, but not every piece of open source software is free. Open source means that the source
code of a piece of software is available and can be consulted without much hurdles. It also means,
usually, that you can take these pieces of software, modify them, and redistribute them without
much hurdles either.</p>
<p>Free software is like open source software, but it’s much more restrictive. That may seem
surprising, because there’s the word <em>free</em> in there, so how could it be more restrictive than open
source software? Consider the following: I can take a piece of open source software (typically
licensed under something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT licenses</a> or the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD licenses</a>) and re-release it with a proprietary
license and sell it. I don’t actually even need to change anything substantial to the source code.
I take that piece of software (which I may or may not modify), repackage it under a new name and
sell it. Free software allows all of this as well (I literally could sell the Linux kernel on this
website if I found people willing to pay me for it), but what it does not allow is only this: I
cannot distribute (by selling or for free) the program without its source code. So if I sold the
Linux kernel on here, I would need to also give out a copy of the source code with it, and this
obviously would also still be necessary if I actually changed something to the source code of the
Linux kernel.</p>
<p>R is licensed under a Free Software license, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_2">GPL
v2</a>, which means that it’s
illegal for anyone to rebrand it, package it and sell it without providing the source code of their
(modified) version of R. Thanks to something like the GPL, it is impossible for companies to employ
what is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">Embrace, Extend and Extinguish</a>, which is a strategy
that Microsoft used in the past. It consists in embracing a piece of software, extending it with
proprietary bits of code and technology, use their dominant position on the desktop to impose their
new version that relies on proprietary bits (or which is 100% proprietary) and then <em>extinguish</em>
the open source version (in the sense that no one will use it anymore because it virtually became
incompatible with the newly imposed Microsoft version).</p>
<p>Now some of you may now be thinking that I’m stuck in the 90’s, after all, Microsoft have been the
good guys for a decade now. They contribute to open source software (not free software), have
bought Github and have not ruined it (yet) and they even included the possibility to run Linux
inside Windows using WSL. So what am I afraid of? Why don’t I trust them?</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/multimillion.jpg" width="100%"></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="all-licenses-have-their-place-but" class="section level2">
<h2>All licenses have their place, but…</h2>
<p>The thing is, I shouldn’t have to trust anyone not to fuck up a piece of free software. Maybe the
current management of Microsoft is not hostile to free software, but maybe that’ll change in the
future. That’s not really the point. The point is that I don’t need to have to trust them, and I’m
happy that a <em>fundamental, crucial</em> piece of software like R uses something like the GPL. But that
doesn’t mean that everything should be licensed under the GPL. For example, as far as I know, every
package of the <code>{tidyverse}</code> uses an MIT license. So just because R is licensed under the GPL
doesn’t mean that its packages all have to be GPL. But I must also admit that while I see why a
company like Posit releases their packages under a permissive license, I don’t see why an
independent developer would do that. I absolutely do not see what independent developers gain from
releasing the code of their packages under anything else than the GPL. (As an aside, go read
<a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/intel/">this</a>… code under a permissive license taken from an
independent developer? check. Nothing was given back to the community? check. The code in question
was used for nefarious purposes? check. Original developer on massive amounts of copium? check).
But, to be fair, I have a grand total of two (2) packages on CRAN that likely get less than 10
downloads a year, so what do I know. One of the arguments I’ve heard is that the GPL is not really
free, because it restricts users from taking the code and releasing it under a proprietary license,
so <em>akshually</em> the MIT/BSD licenses are really the free ones, and if I like freedom so much I
should be using FreeBSD instead of a Linux distro and release my packages under a MIT/BSD license.
I want to ask people that make this argument if they would allow the Nazi party to make a come back
in their countries legislature, then.</p>
<p>That being said, I do release stuff with permissive licenses. For example the content of this blog
or for the courses I teach are under the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/">WTFPL</a>, which is, I
would say, the only acceptable permissive license for independent developers. If the name of the
license was not explicit enough, the comic below illustrates what the WPTFL is all about:</p>

</div>
<div id="can-r-be-used-to-write-proprietary-code" class="section level2">
<h2>Can R be used to write proprietary code</h2>
<p>Yes, you can write proprietary code using R. Microsoft has done so, for example their
<code>{RevoUtilsMath}</code> package is, as far as I know, proprietary, and I’m sure that it includes some R
code. I’m pretty sure it would also be possible to even build a proprietary program that would
require the R interpreter to be bundled to run. As long as the developers of this tool would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release their modified version of R with it (if they modified it);</li>
<li>Tell their users that their program runs with R, and thus also distribute R and its license;</li>
</ul>
<p>R could likely be downloaded at install time in cases like this, again, as long as the users
get notified that it’s needed. I doubt that the rest of the program would need to be licensed
under the GPL, since no code of R itself has been modified.</p>
<p>But I’m not that certain on this last point, so any comments welcome
(on <a href="https://github.com/rbind/b-rodrigues.github.com/issues/4">here</a>).</p>
<p>EDIT: There’s this interesting discussion on stackexchange <a href="https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/7078/is-it-legal-to-use-gpl-code-in-a-proprietary-closed-source-program-by-putting-i">here</a>
and it would seem that the answer is not clearcut, but, it depends. Hence why companies
prefer working using permissive licenses, to avoid these types of discussions.</p>
<p>That’s it, that’s the blog post. Thank GNU for the GPL.</p>
