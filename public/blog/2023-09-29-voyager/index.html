<p>Now for something completely different than our usual programming: today I’m
sharing my thoughts on the latest ZSA mechanical keyboard, the
<a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager/buy/">Voyager</a>. First things first: this is in no
way shape or form sponsored by ZSA. But Erez, if you’d like to send me money
you’re more than welcome.</p>
<p>Here’s what the keyboard looks like:</p>

</div>
<p>Yes, it comes with RGB LEDs. Why do mechanical keyboards come with RGB LEDs? No
idea, I usually don’t care for them, but unlike other keyboards from ZSA, you
cannot order the Voyager without them. So now my keyboard looks like a Christmas
tree. And by the way, yes, you can get the good old regular QWERTY layout
instead of the dots. I chose to get blank keys because I don’t look at my
keyboard when typing.</p>
<p>It’s quite small and there aren’t many keys on it. But it’s very comfortable
to use. I’ll try to explain why.</p>
<p>If you don’t know anything about mechanical keyboards, I think you might find
this blog post useful. I’ll explain the basics and also why you might want to
consider one if you’re a programmer.</p>
<p>First of all, let me just get this out of the way: typing on a mechanical
keyboard will not make you type any faster. I think that people that buy
mechanical keyboards also tend to be people that spend some time learning how to
touch-type, so yeah, they’ll type faster than most people that never bother to
learn to touch-type, but two touch-typists, one that use a mechanical keyboard
and another that uses a normal keyboard, will roughly type at the same speed.</p>
<p>So if not for speed, why bother with mechanical keyboards?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the main advantage of mechanical keyboards is customization. You
can customize absolutely everything: not just how the keyboard looks, but also
how it works. Many mechanical keyboards come with a firmware called QMK which
enables you to program each key. So for instance I have a key that types “&lt;-”
and another that types “%&gt;%”, very useful for an R programmer like myself. You
can configure such things at the level of you favourite text editor, but it’s
nice to also have the option at the level of the hardware, because it means that
you can now easily type these programming symbols anywhere: on social media, an
email, a forum… Configuring this firmware on keyboards made by ZSA, like the
Voyager, is incredibly easy: there’s a web-application called Oryx that you can
use for all they keyboards. Simply select the keys, change what you must and
flash the new firmware to your keyboard! For example here, I’m configuring a
key to output “,” when pressed, but to output “_” when double-tapped:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/oryx.png" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>And for the flashing process you don’t even have to install anything on your
computer: if you’re using a Chromium based browser like Google Chrome, you can
flash it from the Web Browser. You can even browse other people’s
configurations, for example here’s
<a href="https://configure.zsa.io/voyager/layouts/l9eWG/ErJeQ/0">mine</a> (and you can even
customize the RGB).</p>
<p>I use the French ergonomic BÉPO layout, the English equivalent would be Dvorak.
You can add different layers, for example by holding one key, all the other keys
now output something different when pressed (like holding down the SHIFT key
produces capital letters), but you can make any key switch layers and then any
other key output anything. For example I have a layer in which I configured keys
to move my mouse and click. I don’t use that very often, but in case I forget my
mouse if I’m traveling, I could also use my keyboard as a mouse now.</p>
<p>Hardware can also be customized: the color of the keyboard, but also the keycaps
(I have the blank ones, as you’ve seen above) and also the switches. If
you’re not into mechanical keyboard I guess this doesn’t mean anything. Keycaps
are these:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/caps.jpg" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>and switches are these:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/switches.jpg" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>And you can change either the caps, the switches or both. The keyboard is
<em>hot-swapable</em> meaning that you can actually replace the switches. Here is a
switch with a keycap on it that I removed from my keyboard:</p>

</div>
<p>Again, if you’re not into mechanical keyboard it’s difficult to see why this is
really a nice thing: but being able to change caps and switches allows you to
truly make the keyboard feel and sound just right for you.</p>
<p>Let me explain: there’s switches that make no sound and that are very easy to
press: they’re called linear switches. Then there’s switches that make a nice
clicky sound and that require more force to press, and there’s switches that
make even more noise and that require a lot of force to press. The harder ones
are so-called “clicky” switches and the intermediate ones “tactile”. There’s a
lot more subtlety than that, but even I don’t know everything about switches.
What matters is that you can swap these, and find the ones that are just right
for you. My first mechanical keyboard, also one from ZSA, the Ergodox EZ
(pictured below) came with red switches. At the time, I had no idea what
switches I should get, so I bought the reds because they were silent, and I
figured that I would prefer silent ones. Turns out that I absolutely hated them.
It didn’t fill right because they were extremely light, and simply by resting my
hands on the keyboard I would press keys by mistake. Then I bought clicky
switches, and since then haven’t looked back. Clicky switches make a nice
“click” sound when you press them, because there’s actually a little mechanism
that produces this noise when you press them. It’s like pushing an actual
button. Much more satisfying, and much better, in my opinion, for typing. So for
this board I got the white ones, which are the clickiest. It’s also the one’s I
had for my other mechanical keyboard, the Planck EZ, also by ZSA:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/planck.jpg" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>I also experimented with heavier ones on my other board (an Idobao ID75, a
somewhat overgrown Planck, not by ZSA but also very customizable through
<a href="https://get.vial.today/">VIAL</a>):</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/idobao.jpg" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>The switches there are heavier, and I enjoy them a lot as well.</p>
<p>Now, this keyboard isn’t cheap, but it does come with a lot of nice stuff in the
box. You get 3 usb cables, 4 more switches, several keycaps more, and a carrying
bag.</p>
<p>And as you can see, it’s a so-called low profile keyboard:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/low_voyager_1.jpg" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>You can even remove these little feet from the keyboard (they’re magnetic):</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/magnetic_feet.jpg" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>to get it even lower:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/low_voyager_2.jpg" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>I’ve never had such a keyboard in the past and I must say that it’s really
comfortable to use. I don’t need to use any wrist rests anymore, which is kinda
nice. Because it’s low-profile the switches and keycaps are different from the
usual ones you get for other mechanical keyboards:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/mx_vs_choc.jpg" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>Anyways, I really enjoy this form factor, not just that it’s low profile, but
also that it doesn’t have a lot of keys. I like this, because my hands don’t
need to move at all. If I need numbers for example, I switch layers, and now the
keys that would usually be directly under my fingers will output numbers when
pressed. So instead of my fingers going to the keys, they keys go to my fingers.
It gets some time to get used to this, but once you know how to do that, it’s
just great.</p>
<p>So, should you buy a Voyager? I might not advise it to you for a first
mechanical keyboard. There’s much cheaper ones that you can get and see if
mechanical keyboards are for you. If you can, try some out in a store, I think
it’s especially important to find the right switches for your style. As I’ve
written above, I started with linear reds which I hated, thankfully I tried
clicky whites before abandoning my mechanical keyboard adventure. If you’re
already a hardened mechanical keyboard user, and are looking for a light
keyboard that you can take with you on your travels, I think that it’s hard to
overlook the Voyager. There are other nice, very transportable keyboards out
there, but the build quality of ZSA and the firmware customization tool they
provide, Oryx, is hard to beat.</p>
