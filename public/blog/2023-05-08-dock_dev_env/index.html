<p>Last year I wrote a post about dockerizing <code>{targets}</code>’s pipelines (<a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2022-11-19-raps/">link to
post</a>) and between that blog
post and this one, I’ve written a whole book on building reproducible analytical
pipelines that you can read <a href="https://raps-with-r.dev/">here</a> (for free!). In the
book I explain how you can build projects that will stay reproducible thanks to
Docker. With Docker, you don’t only ship the code to your project, but ship <em>a
whole computer</em> with it, and your project will be executed inside that computer.
By <em>whole computer</em> I mean the whole computational environment: so a version of
R, the required packages your project depends on, all of it running on a Linux
distribution (usually Ubuntu). The whole project can then be executed like any
program from your computer (whether you’re running Windows, macOS or Linux) or
even on the cloud with a single command.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll discuss something that I’ve been trying for some time
now: working directly from a dockerized environment. The idea is to have a
Docker image that comes with R, all the usual packages I use for development,
Quarto, a LaTeX distribution (that I installed with <code>{tinytex}</code>) and finally, my
IDE of choice, Spacemacs (if you use RStudio, just read on, I’ll explain how you
can achieve the same thing but with RStudio instead). Why do this? Well because
this way I can deploy the exact same environment anywhere. If I get a new
computer, I’m only one command line away from a functioning environment. If I
want to dockerize a <code>{targets}</code> pipeline, I can write a new Dockerfile that
builds upon this image which ensures that there are no discrepancies between the
development environment and the production environment. And because I’m building
the image on top of a Rocker image, everything just work. If I need to install a
package that might be tricky to install (for example, a package that depends on
<code>{rJava}</code>, using Docker might be the simplest way to get it to work.</p>
<p>So, here’s the Dockerfile:</p>
<pre><code># This builds upon the Rocker project&#39;s versioned image for R version 4.3
FROM rocker/r-ver:4.3

# install `gpg-agent` and `software-properties-common` which are needed to add an Ubuntu ppa to install Emacs
RUN apt-get update \
    &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    gpg-agent software-properties-common

# add the ppa which includes the latest version of Emacs
RUN add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs

# Install `git`, `wget` and the latest `Emacs`
RUN apt-get update \
    &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \

    emacs28-nox

# Install spacemacs by cloning its repository
RUN git clone -b develop https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d

# Download my .spacemacs config file
RUN wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-rodrigues/dotfiles/master/dotfiles/.spacemacs -O ~/.spacemacs

# This launches emacs in daemon mode. This is needed to initialize spacemacs.
# Running it in daemon mode is required because a Dockerfile must be setup non-interactively
RUN emacs --daemon

# Install a bunch of Ubuntu dependencies. These are typical dependencies required to use some
# R packages on Linux.

<p>(and <a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/ess_dev_env">here’s</a> the repository where you can find it).</p>
<p>I’ve explained each line of the Dockerfile using comments in the Dockerfile
itself. But before explaining it in more detail, here’s a word from this blog
post’s sponsor: me, I’m this post’s sponsor.</p>
<p>If you have read until here dear reader, let me express my gratitude by offering
you a <a href="https://leanpub.com/raps-with-r/c/blog_reader">discount code</a> to purchase
a DRM-free Epub and PDF version of my book, Building reproducible analytical
pipelines with R (that you can also read for free
<a href="https://raps-with-r.dev/">here</a> by the way). Using the <a href="https://leanpub.com/raps-with-r/c/blog_reader">discount
code</a> you can get a DRM-free epub
and PDF version of the book for 14.99 instead of 19.99! If you want a good old
physical book instead, you’ll need to wait some more, I still need to get the
formatting right before making it available through Amazon self-publishing
service.</p>
<p>Now back to our Dockerfile. There are several decisions that I took that I need
explain: first, why use a versioned image, and why use the PPPM at a specific
date? I did this so that it doesn’t matter <em>when</em> I build the image, I always
know which version of R and packages I get. Then, what’s with all the options
that I write to the <code>.Rprofile</code>? Well, don’t forget that when I will be running
the Docker container defined by this image, I will be using Emacs inside a
terminal. So if I want to see plots for example, I need to use the <code>{httpgd}</code>
package. This package provides a graphics device that runs on a web server, so
if I tell <code>{httpgd}</code> to serve the images over port <code>8888</code>, and then expose this
port in the Dockerfile, I can access <code>{httpgd}</code> from my web browser by pointing
it to <code>http://localhost:8888</code>. Here’s how this looks like:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/dev_env_httpgd.png" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>The terminal on top of the image is running my dockerized environment, and below
you see my web browser on to the <code>http://localhost:8888/live?token=aaaaaaaa</code>
url to access the <code>{httpgd}</code> web server <em>that is running inside the Docker
container</em>. And it’s the same logic with Shiny: if I’m working on a Shiny app
from inside the container, I can access it by going to <code>http://localhost:8888/</code>.
Now, I have to do all of this because I’m running Emacs, but if you’re
developing with RStudio, you could instead run RStudio server, access it on
<code>http://localhost:8888/</code>, and then no need to think about configuring on which
ports <code>{httpgd}</code> serves images, or on which port Shiny apps should run.
Everything will be directly visible from within RStudio. <a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/blob/master/dockerfiles/rstudio_4.3.0.Dockerfile">Here is
the
Dockerfile</a>
to run R version 4.3 with RStudio as the IDE. If you want to use this, you could
simply start from the above Dockerfile and then add the stuff you need, for example:</p>
<pre><code>FROM rocker/rstudio:4.3.0

# and add what you want below like installing R packages and whatnot</code></pre>
<p>There is still one important thing that you should know before using a
dockerized development environment: a running Docker container can be changed
(for example, you could install new R packages), but once you shut it down and
restart it, any change will be lost. So how do you save your work? Well, you
need to run the Docker image with a volume. A volume is nothing more than a
folder on your computer that is linked to a folder inside the Docker container.
Anything that gets saved there from the Docker container will be available on
your computer, and vice-versa. Here is the command that I use to run my
container:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --rm -it --name ess_dev_env -p 8888:8888 -v /home/path_to_volume/folder:/root/projects:rw brodriguesco/ess_dev_env:main-cdcb1719d emacs</code></pre>
<p>Take note of the <code>-v</code> flag, especially what comes after:
<code>/home/path_to_volume/folder:/root/projects:rw</code>. <code>/home/path_to_volume/folder</code>
is the folder on my computer, and it is linked to the <code>/root/projects</code> folder
inside the Docker container. When I run the above command inside a terminal,
Spacemacs starts and I can get to work! If you build a development environment
based on RStudio, you would essentially use the same command, you would only
need to set a password to login first (read the instructions
<a href="https://rocker-project.org/images/versioned/rstudio.html#how-to-use">here</a>).</p>
<p>Also, if you forgot to add a package and want to install it and make this change
permanent, the best way is to add it to the Dockerfile and rebuild the image.
I’ve streamlined this process by using Github Actions to build images and push
them to Docker Hub. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/ess_dev_env">Github repository where my Dockerfile is
hosted</a>, and if you are familiar
with Github Actions, take a look at my workflow file. You’ll see that I’ve set
up Github Actions to build the Docker image and push it to Docker Hub each time
I commit, and name the Docker image <code>ess_dev_env:main-xxxxx</code> where <code>xxxxx</code> is
the corresponding commit hash on Github (so I can easily know which image was
built with which commit).</p>
<p>I’ll be using this dockerized image for some time, and see how it feels. For now, it
works quite well!</p>
