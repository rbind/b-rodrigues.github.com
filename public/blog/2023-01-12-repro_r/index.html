<p><em>But this table doesn’t show the whole picture, especially the issues with relying so much on
Docker. So if you’re interesting in making science and your work reproducible and robust, my advice
is that you stop doomscrolling on social media and keep on reading. If at the end of the blog post
you think that this was a waste of time, just sent an insult my way, that’s ok.</em></p>
<p>I learnt last week that MRAN is going to get shutdown this year. For those of you that don’t know,
MRAN was a CRAN mirror managed by Microsoft. What made MRAN stand out was the fact that Microsoft
took daily snapshots of CRAN and it was thus possible to quite easily install old packages using
the <code>{checkpoint}</code> package. This was a good thing for reproducibility, and for Windows and macOS,
it was even possible to install binary packages, so no need to compile them from source.</p>
<p>Last year I had the opportunity to teach a course on building reproducible analytical pipelines at
the University of Luxembourg, and made my teaching material available as an ebook that you can find
<a href="https://rap4mads.eu/">here</a>. I also wrote some blog posts about reproducibility and it looks like
I will be continuing this trend for the forseeable future.</p>
<p>So in this blog post I’m going to show what you, as an R user, can do to make your code reproducible now
that MRAN is getting shutdown. MRAN is not the only option for reproducibility, and I’m going to
present in this blog post everything I know about other options. So if you happen to know of some solution
that I don’t discuss here, please leave a comment
<a href="https://github.com/rbind/b-rodrigues.github.com/issues/5">here</a>. But this blog post is not just a tutorial.
I will also discuss what I think is a major risk that is coming and what, maybe, we can do to avoid it.</p>

<div id="reproducibility-is-on-a-continuum" class="section level2">
<h2>Reproducibility is on a continuum</h2>
<p>Reproducibility is on a continuum, and depending on the nature of your project different tools are
needed. First, let’s understand what I mean by “reproducibility is on a continuum”. Let’s suppose
that you have written a script that produces some output. Here is the list of everything that can
influence the output (other than the mathematical algorithm running under the hood):</p>
<ul>
<li>Version of the programming language used;</li>
<li>Versions of the packages/libraries of said programming language used;</li>
<li>Operating System, and its version;</li>
<li>Versions of the underlying system libraries (which often go hand in hand with OS version, but not necessarily).</li>
<li>Hardware that you run all that software stack on.</li>
</ul>
<p>So by “reproducibility is on a continuum”, what I mean is that you could set up your project in a
way that none, one, two, three, four or all of the preceding items are taken into consideration when
making your project reproducible.</p>
<p>There is, however, something else to consider. Before, I wrote “let’s suppose you have written a
script”, which means that you actually have a script laying around that was written in a particular
programming language, and which makes use of a known set of packages/libraries. So for example, if
my script uses the following R packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>dplyr</li>
<li>tidyr</li>
<li>ggplot2</li>
</ul>
<p>I, obviously, know this list and if I want to make my script reproducible, I should take note of
the versions of these 3 packages (and potentially of their own dependencies). However, what if you
don’t know this set of packages that are used? This happens when you want to set up an environment
that is frozen, and then distribute this environment. Developers will then all work on the same
base environment, but you cannot possibly list all the packages that are going to be used because
you have no idea what the developers will end up using (and remember that future you is included in
these developers, and you should always try to be nice to future you).</p>
<p>So these means that we have two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scenario 1: I have a script (or several), and want to make sure that it will always produce the same output;</li>
<li>Scenario 2: I don’t know what I (or my colleagues) will develop, but we want to use the same environment across the organization to develop and deploy data products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Turns out that the solutions to these two scenarios are different, but available in R, even though
we won’t soon be able to count on MRAN anymore. HOWEVER! R won’t suffice for this job.</p>
</div>
<div id="scenario-1-making-a-script-reproducible" class="section level2">
<h2>Scenario 1: making a script reproducible</h2>
<p>Ok, so let’s suppose that I want to make a script reproducible, or at least increase the probability
that others (including future me) will be able to run this script and get the exact same output as
I originally did. If you want to minimize the amount of time spent doing it, the minimum thing you
should do is use <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html">{renv}</a>. <code>{renv}</code> allows you
to create a file called <code>renv.lock</code>. You can then distribute this file to others alongside the code
of your project, or the paper, data, whatever. Nothing else is required from you; if people have
this file, they should be able to set up an environment that would closely mimic the one that was
used to get the results originally (but ideally, you’d invest a bit more time to make your script
run anywhere, for example by avoiding setting absolute paths that only exist on your machine).</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at such an <code>renv.lock</code> file:</p>

<p>as you can see this file lists the R version that was used as well as the different libraries for a
project. Versions of the libraries are also listed, where they came from (CRAN or Github for
example) and these libraries’ requirements as well. So someone who wants to run the original script
in a similar environment has all the info needed to do it. <code>{renv}</code> also provides a simple way to
install all of this. Simply put the <code>renv.lock</code> file in the same folder as the original script and
run <code>renv::restore()</code>, and the right packages with the right versions get automagically installed
(and without interfering with your system-wide, already installed library of packages). The “only”
difficulty that you might have is installing the right version of R. If this is a recent
enough version of R, this shouldn’t be a problem, but installing old software might be difficult.
For example installing R version 2.5 might, or might not, be possible depending on your operating system
(I don’t like microsoft windows, but generally speaking it is quite easy to install very old
software on it, which in the case of Linux distros can be quite difficult. So I guess on windows
this could work more easily). Then there’s also the system libraries that your script might need, and it might
also be difficult to install these older versions. So that’s why I said that providing the
<code>renv.lock</code> file is the bare minimum. But before seeing how we can deal with that, let’s discuss a
scenario 1bis, which is the case where you want to run an old script (say, from 5 years ago), but
there’s no <code>renv.lock</code> file to be found.</p>
</div>
<div id="scenario-1bis-old-script-no-renv.lock-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Scenario 1bis: old script, no renv.lock file</h2>
<p>For these cases I would have used <code>{checkpoint}</code>, but as explained in the intro MRAN is getting
shutdown, and with it out of the picture <code>{checkpoint}</code> will cease to work.</p>
<p>The way <code>{checkpoint}</code> worked is that you would simply add the following line at the very top of
the script in question:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>checkpoint::checkpoint(&quot;2018-12-12&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and this would download the packages needed for the script from that specific date and run your
script. Really, really useful. But unfortunately, Microsoft decided that MRAN should get the axe.
So what else is there? While researching for this blog post, I learned about <code>{groundhog}</code> which
supposedly provides the same functionality. Suppose I have a script from 5 years ago that loads the
following libraries:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>By rewriting this like so (and installing <code>{groundhog}</code> beforehand):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>groundhog.library(&quot;
    library(purrr)
    library(ggplot2)&quot;,
    &quot;2017-10-04&quot;,
    tolerate.R.version = &quot;4.2.2&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><code>{purrr}</code> and <code>{ggplot2}</code> get downloaded as they were on the date I provided. If you want to know
what I had to use the “tolerate.R.version” option, this is because if you try to run it without it,
you get the following very useful message:</p>
<pre><code>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|IMPORTANT.

<p>That’s is pretty neat, as it tells you “hey, getting the right packages is good, but if your R

even work at all”.</p>

</details>
<p>As you can see it failed, very likely because I don’t have the right development libraries
installed on my windows laptop, due to the version mismatch that <code>{groundhog}</code> complained about. I
also tried on my Linux workstation, and got the same outcome. In any case, I want to stress that
this is not <code>{groundhog}</code>’s fault, but this due to the fact that I was here only concerned with
packages; as I said multiple times now, reproducibility is on an continuum, and you also need to
deal with OS and system libraries. So for now, we only got part of the solution.</p>
<p>By the way, you should know 3 more things about <code>{groundhog}</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the earliest available date is, in theory, any date. However, according to its author, <code>{groundhog}</code> should work reliably with a date as early as “2015-04-16”. That’s because the oldest R version <code>{groundhog}</code> is compatible with is R 3.2. However, again according to its author, it should be possible to patch <code>{groundhog}</code> to work with any earlier versions of R.</li>
<li><code>{groundhog}</code>’s developer is <a href="https://github.com/CredibilityLab/groundhog/issues/83#issuecomment-1379932166">planning</a> to save the binary packages off MRAN so that <code>{groundhog}</code> will continue offering binary packages once MRAN is out of the picture, which will make installing these packages more reliable.</li>
<li>On Windows and macOS, <code>{groundhog}</code> installs binary packages if they’re available (which basically is always the case, in the example above it was not the case because I was using Posit’s CRAN mirror, and I don’t think they have binary packages for Windows that are that old. But if using another mirror, that should not be a problem). So if you install the right version of R, you’re almost guaranteed that it’s going to work. But, there is always a but, this also depends on hardware now. I’ll explain in the last part of this blog post, so read on.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="docker-to-the-rescue" class="section level2">
<h2>Docker to the rescue</h2>
<p>The full solution in both scenarios involves Docker. If you are totally unfamiliar with Docker, you
can imagine that Docker makes it easy to set up a Linux virtual machine and run it. In Docker, you
use Dockerfiles (which are configuration files) to define Docker <em>images</em> and you can then run
<em>containers</em> (your VMs, if you wish) based on that image. Inside that Dockerfile you can declare
which operating system you want to use and what you want to run inside of it. For example, here’s a
very simple Dockerfile that prints “Hello from Docker” on the Ubuntu operating system (a popular
Linux distribution):</p>
<pre><code>FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You then need to build the image as defined from this Dockerfile. (Don’t try to follow along for now
with your own computer; I’ll link to resources below so that you can get started if you’re
interested. What matters is that you understand <em>why</em> Docker is needed).</p>
<p>Building the image can be achieved by running this command where the Dockerfile is located:</p>
<pre><code>docker build -t hello .</code></pre>
<p>and then run a container from this image:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --rm -d --name hello_container hello</code></pre>
<pre><code>Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.048kB
Step 1/2 : FROM ubuntu:latest
 ---&gt; 6b7dfa7e8fdb
Step 2/2 : RUN echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
 ---&gt; Running in 5dfbff5463cf
Hello, World!
Removing intermediate container 5dfbff5463cf
 ---&gt; c14004cd1801
Successfully built c14004cd1801
Successfully tagged hello:latest</code></pre>
<p>You should see “Hello, World!” inside your terminal. Ok so this is the very basics. Now why is that useful? It turns
out that there’s the so-called Rocker project, and this project provides a collection of Dockerfiles for current, but also older
versions of R. So if we go back to our <code>renv.lock</code> file from before, we can see which R version was used (it was R 4.2.1) and
define a new Dockerfile that builds upon the
<a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/blob/master/dockerfiles/r-ver_4.2.1.Dockerfile">Dockerfile from the Rocker project for R version 4.2.1</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s first start by writing a very simple script. Suppose that this is the script that we want to make reproducible:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)

data(mtcars)

myplot &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_line(aes(y = hp, x = mpg))

ggsave(&quot;/home/project/output/myplot.pdf&quot;, myplot)</code></pre>
<p>First, let’s assume that I did my homework and that the <code>renv.lock</code> file from before is actually
the one that was generated at the time this script was written. In that case, you could write a
Dockerfile with the correct version of R and use the <code>renv.lock</code> file to install the right
packages. This Dockerfile would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>FROM rocker/r-ver:4.2.1

RUN mkdir /home/project

RUN mkdir /home/project/output

COPY renv.lock /home/project/renv.lock

COPY script.R /home/project/script.R

RUN R -e &quot;install.packages(&#39;renv&#39;)&quot;

RUN R -e &quot;setwd(&#39;/home/project/&#39;);renv::restore(confirm = FALSE)&quot;

CMD R -e &quot;source(&#39;/home/project/script.R&#39;)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We need to put the <code>renv.lock</code> file, as well as the script <code>script.R</code> in the same folder as the Dockerfile,
and then build and run the image:</p>
<pre><code># Build it with
docker build -t project .</code></pre>
<p>run the container (and mount a volume to get the image back – don’t worry if you don’t know what volumes are,
I’ll link resources at the end):</p>
<pre><code>docker run --rm -d --name project_container -v /path/to/your/project/output:/home/project/output:rw project</code></pre>
<p>Even if you’ve never seen a Dockerfile in your life, you likely understand what is going on here:
the first line pulls a Docker image that contains R version 4.2.1 pre-installed on Ubuntu. Then, we
create a directory to hold our files, we copy said files in the directory, and then run several R
commands to install the packages as defined in the <code>renv.lock</code> file and run our script in an
environment that not only has the right versions of the packages but also the right version of R.
This script then saves the plot in a folder called <code>output/</code>, which we link to a folder also called
<code>output/</code> but on our machine, so that we can then look at the generated plot (this is what <code>-v /path/to/your/project/output:/home/project/output:rw</code> does). Just as this script saves a plot, it
could be doing any arbitrarily complex thing, like compiling an Rmarkdown file, running a model,
etc, etc.</p>
<p>Here’s a short video of this process in action:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3E0yd6aFss" title="renv Docker demo"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/E3E0yd6aFss/0.jpg" alt="Link to renv and Docker demo" /></a></p>
<p>Now, let’s do the same thing but for our scenario 1bis that relied on <code>{groundhog}</code>. Before writing the
Dockerfile down, here’s how you should change the script. Add these lines at the very top:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>groundhog::set.groundhog.folder(&quot;/home/groundhog_folder&quot;)

groundhog::groundhog.library(&quot;
    library(purrr)
    library(ggplot2)&quot;,
    &quot;2017-10-04&quot;
    )

data(mtcars)

myplot &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_line(aes(y = hp, x = mpg))

ggsave(&quot;/home/project/output/myplot.pdf&quot;, myplot)</code></pre>
<p>I also created a new script that installs the dependencies of my script when building my Dockerfile. This
way, when I run the container, nothing gets installed anymore. Here’s what this script looks like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>groundhog::set.groundhog.folder(&quot;/home/groundhog_folder&quot;)

groundhog::groundhog.library(&quot;
    library(purrr)
    library(ggplot2)&quot;,
    &quot;2017-10-04&quot;
    )</code></pre>
<p>It’s exactly the beginning from the main script. Now here comes the Dockerfile, and this time it’s going to
be a bit more complicated:</p>
<pre><code>FROM rocker/r-ver:3.4.4

RUN echo &quot;options(repos = c(CRAN=&#39;https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/cran/latest&#39;), download.file.method = &#39;libcurl&#39;)&quot; &gt;&gt; /usr/local/lib/R/etc/Rprofile.site

RUN mkdir /home/project

RUN mkdir /home/groundhog_folder

RUN mkdir /home/project/output

COPY script.R /home/project/script.R

COPY install_deps.R /home/project/install_deps.R

RUN R -e &quot;install.packages(&#39;groundhog&#39;);source(&#39;/home/project/install_deps.R&#39;)&quot;

CMD R -e &quot;source(&#39;/home/project/script.R&#39;)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>As you can see from the first line, this time we’re pulling an image that comes with R 3.4.4. This
is because that version of R was the current version as of 2017-10-04, the date we assumed this
script was written on. Because this is now quite old, we need to add some more stuff to the
Dockerfile to make it work. First, I change the repositories to the current mirror from
<a href="https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/client/#/repos/2/overview">Posit</a>. This is because the
repositories from this image are set to MRAN at a fixed date. This was done at the time for
reproducibility, but now MRAN is getting shutdown, so we need to change the repositories or else
our container will not be able to download packages. Also, <code>{groundhog}</code> will take care of
installing the right package versions. Then I create the necessary folders and run the
<code>install_deps.R</code> script which is the one that will install the packages. This way, the packages get
installed when building the Docker image, and not when running the container, which is preferable.
Finally, the main script gets run, and an output gets produced. Here’s a video showing this
process:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0eG1OvXl9s" title="renv Docker demo"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/g0eG1OvXl9s/0.jpg" alt="Link to the groundhog and Docker demo" /></a></p>
<p>Now all of this may seem complicated, and to be honest it is. Reproducibility is no easy task, but I hope that
I’ve convinced you that by combining <code>{renv}</code> and Docker, or <code>{groundhog}</code> and Docker it is possible to rerun
any analysis. But you do have to be familiar with these tools, and there’s also another issue by using Docker.
Docker works on Windows, macOS and Linux, but the container that runs must be a Linux distribution, usually Ubuntu.
But what if the original analysis was done on Windows and macOS? This can be a problem if the script relies on some
Windows or macOS specific things, which even for a language available on all platforms like R can happen. For example,
I’ve recently noticed that the <code>tar()</code> function in R, which is used to decompress <code>tar.gz</code> files, behaves differently
on Windows than on Linux. So ideally, even if you’re running your analysis on Windows, you should then try
to distribute a working Dockerfile alongside your paper (if you’re a researcher, or if you’re working in the private
sector, you should do the same for each project). Of course, that is quite demanding, and you would need to
learn about these tools, or hire someone to do that for you… But a natural question is then, well, “why
use Docker at all? Since it’s easy to install older versions of R on Windows and macOS, wouldn’t an <code>renv.lock</code>
file suffice? Or even just <code>{groundhog}</code> which is arguably even easier to use?”</p>
<p>Well, more on this later. I still need to discuss scenario 2 first.</p>
</div>
<div id="scenario-2-offering-an-environment-that-is-made-for-reproducibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Scenario 2: offering an environment that is made for reproducibility</h2>
<p>Ok, so this one is easier. In this scenario, you have no idea what people are going to use, so you
cannot generate an <code>renv.lock</code> file beforehand, and <code>{groundhog}</code> is of no help either, because,
well, there’s no scripts yet to actually make reproducible. This is the situation I’ve had for this
project that I’ve discussed at the end of last year, on <a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2022-12-21-longevity/">code
longevity</a> of the R programming language. The
solution is to write a Dockerfile that people can modify and run; this in turn produces some
results that can then be shared. This Dockerfile pulls from another Dockerfile, and that other
Dockerfile is made for reproducibility. How? Because that other Dockerfile is based on Ubuntu
22.04, compiles R 4.2.2 from source, and sets the repositories to
<a href="https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/cran/__linux__/jammy/2022-11-21" class="uri">https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/cran/__linux__/jammy/2022-11-21</a> . This way, the packages get
downloaded exactly as they were on November 21st 2022. So every time this image defined from this
Dockerfile gets built, we get exactly the same environment.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that this solution can be used in the case of scenario 1bis. Let’s say I
have a script from August 2018; by using a Docker image that ships the current version of R at that
time (which should be R version 3.5.x) and Ubuntu (which at the time was 18.04, codenamed Bionic
Beaver) and then using the Posit package manager at a frozen date, for example
<a href="https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/cran/__linux__/bionic/2018-08-16" class="uri">https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/cran/__linux__/bionic/2018-08-16</a> I should be able to reproduce
an environment that is close enough. However the problem is that Posit’s package manager earliest
available date is Octobre 2017, so anything before that would not be possible to reproduce.</p>
<p>Ok, great, here are the solutions for reproducibility. But there are still problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-single-point-of-failure-docker" class="section level2">
<h2>A single point of failure: Docker</h2>
<p>Let’s be blunt: having Docker as the common denominator in all these solutions is a problem. This is
because Docker represents a single point of failure. But the problem is not Docker itself, but the
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Let me explain: Docker is based on many different open source parts, and that’s great. There’s also
Podman, which is basically a drop-in replacement (when combined with other tools) made by Red Hat,
which is completely open source as well. So the risk does not come from there, because even if for
some reason Docker would disappear, or get abandoned or whatever, we could still work with Podman,
and it would likely be possible to create a fork from Docker.</p>
<p>But the issue is the infrastructure. For now, using Docker and more importantly hosting images is
free for personal use, education, open source communities and small businesses. So this means that
a project like Rocker likely pays nothing for hosting all the images they produce (but who knows, I
may be wrong on this). And Rocker makes a lot of images. See, at the top of the Dockerfiles I’ve used
in this blog post, there’s always a statement like:</p>
<pre><code>FROM rocker/r-ver:4.2.1</code></pre>
<p>as explained before, this states that a pre-built image that ships R version 4.2.1 on Ubuntu gets downloaded.
But from where? This image gets downloaded from Docker Hub, see
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/rocker/r-ver/4.2.1/images/sha256-3636493af7028d899a6598ee4aabe70d231fb0ff60f61a70f8ea0ea24a51c3e6?context=explore">here</a>.</p>
<p>This means that you can download this pre-built image and don’t need to build it each time you need
to work with it. You can simply use that as a base for your work, like the image built for reproducibility
described in scenario 2. But what happens if at some point in the future Docker changes its licensing
model? What if they still have a free tier, but massively limit the amount of images that get
hosted for free? What if they get rid of the free tier entirely? This is a massive risk that needs to be
managed in my opinion. There is the option of the Rocker project hosting the images themselves.
It is possible to create your own, self-hosted Docker registry and not use Docker
Hub, after all. But this is costly not only in terms of storage, but also of manpower to maintain all this.
But maybe worse than that is: what if at some point in the future you cannot rebuild these
images, at all? You would need to make sure that these pre-built images do not get lost. And this is
already happening because of MRAN getting shutdown. In this blog post I’ve used the
<code>rocker/r-ver:3.4.4</code> image to run code from 2017. The problem is that if you look at its
Dockerfile, you see that building this image <a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned/blob/1920e7cfc757bad02d041a0bddec1a18b1ebc4c1/r-ver/3.4.4.Dockerfile#L118">requires
MRAN</a>.
So in other words, once MRAN is offline, it won’t be possible to rebuild this image, and the Rocker
project will need to make sure that the pre-built image that is currently available on Docker Hub
stays available forever. Because if not, it would be quite hard to rerun code from, say, 2017. Same
goes for Posit’s package manager. Posit’s package manager could be used as a drop-in replacement
for MRAN, but for how long? Even though Posit is a very responsible company, I believe that it is
dangerous that such a crucial service is managed by only one company.</p>
<p>And rebuilding old images will be necessary. This is now the part where I answer the question from above:</p>
<p>“why use Docker at all? Since it’s easy to install older versions of R on Windows and macOS, wouldn’t an <code>renv.lock</code>
file suffice? Or even just <code>{groundhog}</code> which is arguably even easier to use?”</p>
<p>The problem is hardware. You see, Apple has changed hardware architecture recently, their new computers
switched from Intel based hardware to their own proprietary architecture (Apple Silicon) based on the ARM specification.
And what does that mean concretely? It means that all the binary packages that were built for Intel based
Apple computers cannot work on their new computers. Which means that if you have a recent M1 Macbook and
need to install old CRAN packages (for example, by using <code>{groundhog}</code>), these need to be compiled to work
on M1. You cannot even install older versions of R, unless you also compile those from source! Now I have
read about a compatibility layer called Rosetta which enables to run binaries compiled for the Intel architecture
on the ARM architecture, and maybe this works well with R and CRAN binaries compiled
for Intel architecture. Maybe, I don’t know. But my point is that you never know what might come in the future,
and thus needing to be able to compile from source is important, because compiling from source is what
requires the least amount of dependencies that are outside of your control. Relying on binaries is not future-proof.</p>
<p>And for you Windows users, don’t think that the preceding paragraph does not concern you. I think that it is
very likely that Microsoft will push in the future for OEM manufacturers to develop more ARM based computers.
There is already an ARM version of Windows after all, and it has been around for quite some time, and I think
that Microsoft will not kill that version any time in the future.
This is because ARM is much more energy efficient than other architectures, and any manufacturer can
build its own ARM cpus by purchasing a license, which can be quite interesting. For example in the case
of Apple silicon cpus, Apple can now get exactly the cpus they want for their machines and make their
software work seamlessly with it. I doubt that others will pass the chance to do the same.</p>
<p>Also, something else that might happen is that we might move towards more and more cloud based computing,
but I think that this scenario is less likely than the one from before. But who knows. And in that case
it is quite likely that the actual code will be running on Linux servers that will likely be ARM based
because of energy costs. Here again, if you want to run your historical code, you’ll have to compile
old packages and R versions from source.</p>
<p>Basically, binary packages are in my opinion not a future-proof option, so that’s why something like
Docker will stay, and become ever more relevant. But as I argued before, that’s a single point of failure.</p>
<p>But there might be a way we can solve this and not have to rely on Docker at all.</p>

<div id="guix-toward-practical-transparent-verifiable-and-long-term-reproducible-research" class="section level2">
<h2>Guix: <em>toward practical transparent verifiable and long-term reproducible research</em></h2>
<p>The title of this section is the same as the title from a research paper published in 2022 that you
can read <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01720-9#Abs1">here</a>.</p>
<p>This paper presents and shows how to use Guix, which is a tool to build, from scratch and in a
reproducible manner, the computational environment that was used to run some code for research. Very
importantly, Guix doesn’t rely on containers, virtual machines or anything like that. From my,
albeit still limited, understanding of how it works, Guix requires some recipes telling it how it
should build software. Guix integrates with CRAN, so it’s possible to tell Guix “hey, could you
build ggplot2” and Guix does as instructed. It builds <code>{ggplot2}</code> and all the required
dependencies. And what’s great about Guix is that it’s also possible to build older versions of
software.</p>
<p>The authors illustrate this by reproducing results from a 2019 paper, by recreating the environment
used at the time, 3 years later.</p>
<p>This could be a great solution, because it would always allow the recreation of computational
environments from source. So architecture changes would not be a problem, making Guix quite future
proof. The issue I’ve found though, is that Guix only works on Linux. So if you’re working on
Windows or macOS, you would need Docker to recreate a computational environment with Guix. So you
could think that we’re back to square one, but actually no. Because you could always have a Linux
machine or server that you would use for reproducibility, on which Linux is installed, thus
eliminating the need for Docker, thus removing that risk entirely.</p>
<p>I’m currently exploring Guix and will report on it in greater detail in the future. In the
meantime, I hope to have convinced you that, while reproducibility is no easy task, the tools that
are currently available can help you set up reproducible project. However, for something to be and
stay truly reproducible, some long term maintenance is also required.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So here we are, these are, as far as I know, the options to make your code reproducible. But it is
no easy task and it takes time. Unfortunately, many scientists are not really concerned with making
their code reproducible, simply because there is no real incentive for them to do it. And it’s
a task that is becoming more and more complex as there are other risks that need to be managed,
like the transition from Intel based architectures for cpus towards ARM. I’m pretty sure there
are many scientists who have absolutely no idea what Intel based cpus or ARM cpus or Rosetta or whatever
are. So telling them they need to make their code reproducible is one thing, telling them they
need to make it so future proof that architecture changes won’t matter is like asking for the Moon.</p>
<p>So research software engineers will become more and more crucial, and should be integrated to research
teams to deal with this question (and this also holds true for the private sector; there should be someone
whose job is make code reproducible across the organization).</p>
<p>Anyways, if you read until here, I appreciate it. This was a long blog post. If you want to know more, you can read
this <a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2022-11-19-raps/">other blog post</a> of mine that explains how to use Docker,
and also this <a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2022-11-30-pipelines-as/">other blog post</a>
that explains why Docker <em>is not</em> optional (but now that I’ve discovered Guix, maybe it’s Guix that is not
optional).</p>
