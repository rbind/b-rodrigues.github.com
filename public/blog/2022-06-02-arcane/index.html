<p>R will always be arcane to those who do not make a serious effort to learn it.
It is <strong>not</strong> meant to be intuitive and easy for casual users to just plunge into.
It is far too complex and powerful for that.
But the rewards are great for serious data analysts who put in the effort.</p>

<p>I’ve posted this quote on twitter the other day and it sparked some discussion. Personally I agree
with this quote, and I’ll explain why.</p>
<p>Just like any tool aimed at professionals, R requires people to spend time to actually master it.
There is no ifs or buts. Just like I don’t want a casual carpenter doing my carpentry, or a casual
electrician doing the wiring in my house, I don’t think anyone should want to be a casual R user.
Now of course, depending on your needs, you might not need to learn everything the language has to
offer. I certainly don’t know everything R has to offer, far from it. But whatever task you need to
fulfill, take the time to learn the required syntax and packages. As Berton Gunter said in 2007,
<em>the rewards are great</em> if you put in the effort. You need to create top notch plots? Master
<code>{ggplot2}</code>. Need to create top notch web apps? <code>{shiny}</code>, and so on and so forth… you get the
idea. But as a shiny expert, you might not need to know, nor care, about R’s object oriented
capabilities for example.</p>
<p>That’s fine.</p>

<p>I remember being extremely frustrated when I started to learn R, not because the language was
overly complex, (even if that was the case in the beginning, but honestly, that’s true for any
language, even for supposedly piss-easy languages <a href="https://twitter.com/Aella_Girl/status/1522633160483385345">like
Python</a>) but because my professors kept
saying “no need to learn the language in great detail, we’re economists after all, not
programmers”. That didn’t seem right, and now that I’ve been working with R for years (and with
economists for some time as well), it certainly is important, even for economists, to be quite
fluent in at least one programming language like R. How fluent should you be? Well, enough that you
can test new ideas, or explore new data without much googling nor friction. Your creativity and
curiosity cannot be limited by your lack of knowledge of the tools you need to use.</p>
<p>Some people posit that the <code>{tidyverse}</code> (and Rstudio, the GUI interface) made R more accessible.
I’d say yes and no. On one hand, the tidyverse has following nice things going for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistent api across packages. That definitely makes R easier to learn!</li>
<li>Made the <code>%&gt;%</code> operator famous, which improves readability.</li>
<li>Top notch documentation, and also many packages come with books that you can read online for free! That certainly makes R easier to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>(and Rstudio was the first, really good, GUI for R).</p>
<p>But while this is all true, on the other hand, the <code>{tidyverse}</code> also makes it possible to write
code like this (I’ll be using the <code>package::function()</code> to make the origin of the functions clear):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggfortify) # Not part of the tidyverse, but needed to make ggplot2::autoplot work on lm
library(ggplot2)
library(broom) # Not part of the tidyverse, but adheres to the *tidy* principles

result &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%
  dplyr::group_nest(am) %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(models = purrr::map(data, ~lm(hp ~ mpg + cyl, data = .))) %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(diag_plots = purrr::map(models, ggplot2::autoplot)) %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(model_summary = purrr::map(models, broom::tidy))</code></pre>
<p><code>result</code> is now a data frame with several columns:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>result</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 × 5
##      am                data models diag_plots model_summary   
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&lt;tibble[,10]&gt;&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;list&gt;     &lt;list&gt;          
## 1     0           [19 × 10] &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;ggmltplt&gt; &lt;tibble [3 × 5]&gt;
## 2     1           [13 × 10] &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;ggmltplt&gt; &lt;tibble [3 × 5]&gt;</code></pre>
<p><code>am</code> defines the groups, and then <code>data</code>, <code>models</code> and <code>model_summary</code> are list-columns containing
complex objects (data frames, models, and plots, respectively). And don’t get me wrong here,
this is not code that I made look complicated on purpose. This type of workflow is <em>canon</em>
in the tidyverse lore. This is how you can avoid for loops and keep every result together neatly
in a single object.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another esoteric example: imagine I want to publish a paper and am only interested in
the coefficients of the model where the p-value is less than .05 (lol):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mtcars %&gt;%
  dplyr::group_nest(am) %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(models = purrr::map(data, ~lm(hp ~ mpg + cyl, data = .))) %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(model_summary = purrr::map(models, broom::tidy)) %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(model_summary = purrr::map(model_summary, \(x)(filter(x, p.value &lt; .05))))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 × 4
##      am                data models model_summary   
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&lt;tibble[,10]&gt;&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;list&gt;          
## 1     0           [19 × 10] &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;tibble [2 × 5]&gt;
## 2     1           [13 × 10] &lt;lm&gt;   &lt;tibble [1 × 5]&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I’ve mapped an anomymous function to the model summary, to filter out p-values greater than .05.
Do you think this looks comprehensible to the beginner? I don’t think so. But I also don’t think that
the beginners must stay beginners, and this is what matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually, I see it as part of my job to inflict R on people who are perfectly happy to have never heard of it.
Happiness doesn’t equal proficient and efficient.
In some cases the proficiency of a person serves a greater good than their momentary happiness.</p>

<p>I’d argue that R, as arcane as it is (or not), is very likely one of the easiest languages to
learn, and this is because there are a lot, and I mean a lot, of resources online:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free books (just take a look at the <a href="https://www.bigbookofr.com/">big book of R</a> to find everything you need)</li>
<li>Youtube channels dedicated to R (I’m shamelessly plugging <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZXht1RTL2Duc3eU8MYGzQ">mine</a>)</li>
<li>Packages with great documentation (take a look at the <a href="https://easystats.github.io/easystats/">easystats</a> suite for an example,
or <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/index.html">modelsummary</a> and <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/">marginaleffects</a>, both by Vincent Arel Bundock, and I’m not citing many, many others here)</li>
<li>Slack channels where you can get help</li>
<li>The community of R users on twitter (check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats">#RStats</a> hashtag)</li>
<li>The <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/#">RStudio Community forums</a></li>
<li>And of course, the good old <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help">R-help mailing list</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s only the free stuff. If you can afford it, there’s plenty of courses available as well.
But no amount of free or paid content will be enough if you don’t invest enough time to learn the language,
and this is true of <em>anything</em>. There are no secret recipes.</p>
<p>P.S.: I got all these quotes from the <code>{fortunes}</code> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fortunes/index.html">package</a>.</p>
