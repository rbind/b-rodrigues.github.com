</div>
<p>Back in June I self-published a book on Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing
service and wrote a blog post detailling how you could achieve that using
Quarto, which you can read
<a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2023-06-29-book_quarto/">here</a>. The book is
about <a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/about/books/">building reproducible analytical pipelines with
R</a>. For the purposes of this post I made
a <a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/kdp_quarto">template on Github</a> that you could
fork and use as a starting point to write your own book. The book also gets
built using Github Actions each time you push new changes: a website gets built,
an E-book for e-ink devices and a Amazon KDP-ready PDF for print get also built.
That template used dedicated actions to install the required version of R,
Quarto, and R packages (using <code>{renv}</code>).</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the workflow file:</p>
<pre><code>on:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Render and Publish

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup pandoc
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-pandoc@v2

      - name: Setup R
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: &#39;4.3.1&#39;

      - name: Setup renv
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
        with:
          # To install LaTeX to build PDF book 
          tinytex: true 
          # uncomment below and fill to pin a version
          #version: 1.3.353

      - name: Publish to GitHub Pages (and render)
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this secret is always available for github actions</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, there are a lot of different moving pieces to get this to work.
Since then I discovered Nix (if you’ve not been following my adventures, there’s
6 other parts to this series as of today), and now I wrote another template that
uses Nix to handle the book’s dependencies instead of dedicated actions and
<code>{renv}</code>. You can find the repository
<a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/quarto_book_nix">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here is what the workflow file looks like:</p>
<pre><code>name: Build book using Nix

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Install Nix
      uses: DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main
      with:
        logger: pretty
        log-directives: nix_installer=trace
        backtrace: full

    - name: Nix cache
      uses: DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action@main

    - name: Build development environment
      run: |
        nix-build

    - name: Publish to GitHub Pages (and render)
      uses: b-rodrigues/quarto-nix-actions/publish@main
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} </code></pre>
<p>The first thing you should notice is that this file is much shorter.</p>
<p>The first step, <code>Checkout Code</code> makes the code available to the rest of the
steps. I then install Nix on this runner using the Determinate Systems
<code>nix-installer-action</code> and then I use another action from Determinate Systems,
the <code>magic-nix-cache-action</code>. This action caches all the packages so that they
don’t need to get re-built each time a change gets pushed, speeding up the
process by a lot. The development environment gets then built using <code>nix-build</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, an action I defined runs, <code>quarto-nix-actions/publish</code>. This is a fork
of the <code>quarto-actions/publish</code> action which you can find
<a href="https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/blob/main/publish/action.yml">here</a>.
My fork simply makes sure that the <code>quarto render</code> and <code>quarto publish</code> commands
run in the <a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/quarto-nix-actions/blob/f48f5a7813eb4978a2f557ff45bcc854526fb80b/publish/action.yml#L58">Nix environment defined for the
project</a>.</p>
<p>You can see the book website
<a href="https://b-rodrigues.github.io/quarto_book_nix/">here</a>; read it, it’s explains
everything in much more details than this blog post! But if you’re busy, read
continue reading this blog post instead.</p>
<p>The obvious next question is why bother with this second, Nix-centric, approach?</p>
<p>There are at least three reasons. The first is that it is possible to define
so-called <code>default.nix</code> files that the Nix package manager then uses to build a
fully reproducible development environment. This environment will contain all
the packages that you require, and will not interfere with any other packages
installed on your system. This essentially means that you can have
project-specific <code>default.nix</code> files, each specifying the requirements for
specific projects. This file can then be used as-is on any other platform to
re-create your environment. The second reason is that when installing a package
that requires system-level dependencies, <code>{rJava}</code> for example, all the
lower-level dependencies get automatically installed as well. Forget about
reading error messages of <code>install.packages()</code> to find which system development
library you need to install first. The third reason is that you can pin a
specific revision of <code>nixpkgs</code> to ensure reproducibility.</p>
<p>The <code>nixpkgs</code> mono-repository is “just” a Github repository which you can find
here: <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs</a>. This
repository contains Nix expressions to build and install more than 80’000
packages and you can search for installable Nix packages
<a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages">here</a>.</p>
<p>Because <code>nixpkgs</code> is a “just” Github repository, it is possible to use a
specific commit hash to install the packages as they were at a specific point in
time. For example, if you use this commit, <code>7c9cc5a6e</code>, you’ll get the very
latest packages as of the 19th of October 2023, but if you used this one
instead: <code>976fa3369</code>, you’ll get packages from the 19th of August 2023.</p>
<p>This ability to deal with both underlying system-level dependencies and pin
package versions at a specific commit is extremely useful on Git(Dev)Ops
platforms like Github Actions. Debugging installation failures of packages can
be quite frustrating, especially on Github Actions, and especially if you’re not
already familiar with how Linux distributions work. Having a tool that handles
all of that for you is amazing. The difficult part is writing these
<code>default.nix</code> files that the Nix package manager requires to actually build
these development environments. But don’t worry, with my co-author <a href="https://github.com/philipp-baumann">Philipp
Baumann</a>, we developed an R package called
<code>{rix}</code> which generates these <code>default.nix</code> files for you.</p>
<p><code>{rix}</code> is an R package that makes it very easy to generate very complex
<code>default.nix</code> files. These files can in turn be used by the Nix package manager
to build project-specific environments. The book’s Github repository contains a
file called <code>define_env.R</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rix)

rix(r_ver = &quot;4.3.1&quot;,
    r_pkgs = c(&quot;quarto&quot;),
    system_pkgs = &quot;quarto&quot;,
    tex_pkgs = c(
      &quot;amsmath&quot;,
      &quot;framed&quot;,
      &quot;fvextra&quot;,
      &quot;environ&quot;,
      &quot;fontawesome5&quot;,
      &quot;orcidlink&quot;,
      &quot;pdfcol&quot;,
      &quot;tcolorbox&quot;,
      &quot;tikzfill&quot;
    ),
    ide = &quot;other&quot;,
    shell_hook = &quot;&quot;,
    project_path = &quot;.&quot;,
    overwrite = TRUE,
    print = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p><code>{rix}</code> ships the <code>rix()</code> function which takes several arguments. These
arguments allow you to specify an R version, a list of R packages, a list of
system packages, TeXLive packages and other options that allow you to specify
your requirements. Running this code generates this <code>default.nix</code> file:</p>
<pre><code># This file was generated by the {rix} R package v0.4.1 on 2023-10-19
# with following call:
# &gt;rix(r_ver = &quot;976fa3369d722e76f37c77493d99829540d43845&quot;,
#  &gt; r_pkgs = c(&quot;quarto&quot;),
#  &gt; system_pkgs = &quot;quarto&quot;,
#  &gt; tex_pkgs = c(&quot;amsmath&quot;,
#  &gt; &quot;framed&quot;,
#  &gt; &quot;fvextra&quot;,
#  &gt; &quot;environ&quot;,

#  &gt; &quot;orcidlink&quot;,

#  &gt; project_path = &quot;.&quot;,
#  &gt; overwrite = TRUE,
#  &gt; print = TRUE,
#  &gt; shell_hook = &quot;&quot;)

<p>This file defines the environment that is needed to build your book: be it
locally on your machine, or on a GitOps platform like Github Actions. All that
matters is that you have the Nix package manager installed (thankfully, it’s
available for Windows –through WSL2–, Linux and macOS).</p>
<p>Being able to work locally on a specific environment, defined through code, and
use that environment on the cloud as well, is great. It doesn’t matter that the
code runs on Ubuntu on the Github Actions runner, and if that operating system
is not the one you use as well. Thanks to Nix, your code will run on exactly the
same environment. Because of that, you can use <code>ubuntu-latest</code> as your runner,
because exactly the same packages will always get installed. This is not the
case with my first template that uses dedicated actions and <code>{renv}</code>: there, the
runner uses <code>ubuntu-22.04</code>, a fixed version of the Ubuntu operating system. The
risk here, is that once these runners get decommissioned (Ubuntu 22.04 is a
<em>long-term support</em> release of Ubuntu, so it’ll stop getting updated sometime in
2027), my code won’t be able to run anymore. This is because there’s no
guarantee that the required version of R, Quarto, and all the other packages I
need will be installable on that new release of Ubuntu. So for example, suppose
I have the package <code>{foo}</code> at version 1.0 that requires the system-level
development library <code>bar-dev</code> at version 0.4 to be installed on Ubuntu. This is
not an issue now, as Ubuntu 22.04 ships version 0.4 of <code>bar-dev</code>. But it is very
unlikely that the future version of Ubuntu from 2027 will ship that version, and
there’s no guarantee my package will successfully build and work as expected
with a more recent version of <code>bar-dev</code>. With Nix, this is not an issue; because
I pin a specific commit of <code>nixpkgs</code>, not only will <code>{foo}</code> at version 1.0 get
installed, its dependency <code>bar-dev</code> at version 0.4 will get installed by Nix as
well, and get used to build <code>{foo}</code>. It doesn’t matter that my underlying
operating system ships a more recent version of <code>bar-dev</code>. I really insist on
this point, because this is not something that you can easily deal with, even
with Docker. This is because when you use Docker, you need to be able to rebuild
the image as many times as you need (the alternative is to store, forever, the
built image), and just like for Github Actions runners, the underlying Ubuntu
image will be decommissioned and stop working one day.</p>
<p>In other words, if you need long-term reproducibility, you should really
consider using Nix, and even if you don’t need long-term reproducibility, you
should really consider using Nix. This is because Nix makes things much easier.
But there is one point where Nix is at a huge disadvantage when compared to the
alternatives: the entry cost is quite high, as I’ve discussed in my <a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2023-10-05-repro_overview/">previous
blog post</a>. But I’m
hoping that through my blog posts, this entry cost is getting lowered for R
users!</p>
