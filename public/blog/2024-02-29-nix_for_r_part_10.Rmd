I’ve very recently started contributing to the `nixpkgs` repository of packages,
which contains all the packages you can install from the Nix package manager. My
contributions are fairly modest: I help fix R packages that need some tweaking
to make them successfully build for Nix. Most of these fixes are very simple
one-liners.

Most users of any free and open source tool rarely contribute to the development
of this tool: I don’t think it is due to lack of skills and/or time or interest,
but mostly because starting to contribute to a tool requires some knowledge that
is rarely written down (even more so for an entire ecosystem). These tools and
ecosystems grow organically, and if you’re not in the right spot at the right
time or are not lucky enough to have kind people taking time to explain things
to you, contributing might feel completely overwhelming.

Thankfully, I was very lucky to have found the small but very active
community of R contributors to `nixpkgs` on
[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#r:nixos.org) which very kindly took the time
to bring me up to speed!

I wanted to share my experiences in this blog post: but this blog post is not
just going to be about me contributing to `nixpkgs` from the perspective of an R
user (and giving you some pointers on how to start yourself), but also about how
I built a report (let’s call it like that) to keep track of which R packages got
fixed. This report is built using R, Nix, Github Actions and lists all the failed
R package builds from Hydra (more on this later). The report gets updated
every day automatically at midnight, and is accessible
[here](https://raw.githack.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/targets-runs/output/r-updates-fails.html).
I also used a very minimalistic approach to build this: no `{tidyverse}`
packages, and no Quarto. Why? Mostly just to keep dependencies at a minimum to
accelerate CI/CD, but also for fun. And honestly, I must admit that base R is
more than capable on its own and had forgotten that.

## Contributing to nixpkgs

As explained in 
[part 8](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2023-12-19-nix_for_r_part_8/), `nixpkgs` is
"nothing but" a huge GitHub repository containing thousands of Nix expressions.
These expressions are then used to actually build the software that then gets
installed by Nix. For example, [this is the expression for
Quarto](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixpkgs-unstable/pkgs/development/libraries/quarto/default.nix).
As you can see, it starts by downloading the pre-compiled binary, and then
applying "patches". Essentially making sure that Quarto installed by Nix is able
to find the other pieces installed by Nix that Quarto needs (Deno, Pandoc, Typst
and so on). It then continues by installing Quarto itself (because we’re
downloading a pre-compiled binary, *installation* consists in moving files in
the right spot), finally some tests are executed (`quarto check`) and then some
metadata is defined. Not every package is defined like this, with a single Nix
expression, though. For example, individual R packages are not defined like
this. Instead, every package from CRAN and Bioconductor gets built using only a
handful of files that can be found
[here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/nixpkgs-unstable/pkgs/development/r-modules).

(By the way, you can look for packages and find their associated Nix expressions
on the [NixOS package search](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=quarto)).

The way this works, is that periodically the
[`generate-r-packages.R`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/r-modules/generic-builder.nix)
script is run and generates the
[`cran-packages.nix`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/r-modules/cran-packages.nix)
file (and the equivalent Bioconductor files). For each package on CRAN, a line gets written in the script
with the package’s name, its current version on CRAN, and very importantly its
dependencies. For example, here is the line for `{dplyr}`:

```
dplyr = derive2 { name="dplyr"; version="1.1.4";
   sha256="1jsq8pj12bngy66xms486j8a65wxvyqs944q9rxkiaylsla08wyg";
   depends=[cli generics glue lifecycle magrittr pillar R6 rlang tibble tidyselect vctrs]; };
```

These dependencies are actually the packages that can be found in the
[`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/DESCRIPTION) file
under `Imports`.
[`cran-packages.nix`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/r-modules/cran-packages.nix)
(and the same goes for the Bioconductor equivalents, `bioc-packages.nix`,
`bioc-annotation-packages.nix` and `bioc-experiment-packages.nix`) get imported
in the
[`default.nix`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/r-modules/default.nix)
file. In it, another file, `generic-builder.nix` gets also imported, which
contains a function that will attempt building the package. Most of the time
this succeeds, but some packages require further tweaks. Packages that have a
field `NeedsCompilation` in their DESCRIPTION files are usually candidates for
further tweaking: these packages require system-level dependencies, which are
often listed under `SystemRequirements` (but not always, which complicates
matters). For example, the `{terra}` package has these system requirements
listed in itself DESCRIPTION file:

```
SystemRequirements:	C++17, GDAL (>= 2.2.3), GEOS (>= 3.4.0), PROJ (>= 4.9.3), sqlite3
```

so these also need to be added if we want to build them on Nix. But if we look at the 
line for `{terra}` in `cran-packages.nix`, this is what we see:

```
terra = derive2 { name="terra"; version="1.7-65"; 
  sha256="0m9s5am8l6il1q0skab614cx0qjsb1i9xcv6nm0sdzj7p9lrzkfl"; 
  depends=[Rcpp]; };
```

Only `{Rcpp}` is listed, which is a dependency, yes, but an R package
dependency, not a system-level requirement. System-level requirements need to
be added in the `default.nix` file manually. In the `default.nix`, you’ll find a
long list of packages called `packagesWithNativeBuildInputs` and
`packagesWithBuildInputs`. *NativeBuildInputs* and *BuildInputs* are Nix jargon
for dependencies the package needs, at compile-time and then at run-time
specifically. For example, `{Rcpp}` is a *BuildInput* of `{terra}`, while the
system-level requirements are *NativeBuildInputs* (in the context of R packages
though, this rarely matters. If you want more details, refer to [this
Gist](https://gist.github.com/b-rodrigues/c677b59126d05d43347ed9623ddd5b0c) I’ve
forked).

For `{terra}`, this means that we need to add this line to the list
`{packagesWithNativeBuildInputs}` (I simplified the syntax here a bit):

```
terra = [ gdal proj geos ];
```

`gdal`, `proj` and `geos` are the system requirements that need to be added for
`{terra}` to build successfully on Hydra.

## Hydra

*Hydra is a tool for continuous integration testing and software release that
uses a purely functional language to describe build jobs and their dependencies*
(source: [the Hydra
Manual](https://hydra.nixos.org/build/248007843/download/1/hydra/#introduction))

If you’re coming from R, think of Hydra as [R-hub](https://builder.r-hub.io/),
which will check and build your R package before submitting to CRAN. Hydra
periodically tries to rebuild packages. If that package fails, then the log
gets hosted. When it comes to R packages, we can check which packages
built successfully or not on [here](https://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/nixpkgs/r-updates).

As of writing, the latest evaluation was in mid-January. A new release of R is
going to get released on the 29th of February (or maybe was already released,
I’m not sure when this blog post is going to get posted), and this is when new
evaluations will likely be executed. Evaluations are the processes by which Nix
expressions get... evaluated and used to actually build packages. So if we look
into the results of the evaluation of the 17th of January, we see that 757 jobs
failed:

<div style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="/img/hydra_failing_jobs.jpg" width="80%">
</div>

One job doesn’t strictly correspond to one package though: packages get built for different
architectures, and each architecture gets its build process. If we log into the details
of the first package whose build failed `{AIUQ}`, we see this:

<div style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="/img/hydra_failed.jpg" width="80%">
</div>

From the log we see that actually what failed one of its dependencies, `{SuperGauss}`, 
so fixing `{SuperGauss}` will likely fix `{AIUQ}` (I say likely because maybe another
needed dependency also fails). So we could try to fix `{SuperGauss}` first. Let’s see
why `{SuperGauss}`, by clicking on `raw`:

<div style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="/img/hydra_failed_raw.jpg" width="80%">
</div>


Here is what we see:

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables FFTW_CFLAGS
and FFTW_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

To get pkg-config, see <http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/>.
See `config.log' for more details
ERROR: configuration failed for package 'SuperGauss'
* removing '/nix/store/jxv5p85x24xmfcnifw2ibvx9jhk9f2w4-r-SuperGauss-2.0.3/library/SuperGauss'
```

This is essentially what we would see if we tried to install `{SuperGauss}` on
Linux. The error message is quite clear here: a system-level dependency,
`pkg-config` is missing. Looks like we found our first package to fix!

## Fixing a package

The first step is to fork and clone the `nixpkgs` GitHub repository to your
computer (be patient, the repository is huge so the download will take some
time):

```
git clone git@github.com:b-rodrigues/nixpkgs.git
```

It’s also a good idea to add the original `nixpkgs` as an `upstream`:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs
```

This way, you can pull changes from the original `nixpkgs` repository into your
fork easily with:

```
git fetch upstream master
git merge upstream/master
```

These two commands synchronize your local copy of the repository with upstream.
So now we can create a new branch to try to fix `{SuperGauss}`:

```
git branch -b fix_supergauss
```

and then we should try to build `{SuperGauss}` locally. This is because
it might have been fixed in the meantime by someone else, so let’s try to
build it with (run the following command in a terminal at the root of
your local copy of the `nixpkgs` repository):

```
nix-build -A rPackages.SuperGauss
```

but I often prefer to use this instead, because this will build the package
and drop me into a shell where I can start R, load the package, and try it
    by running some of its examples:

```
nix-shell -I nixpkgs=/path/to/my/nixpkgs -p rPackages.SuperGauss R
```

If any of the commands above fail with the same error message as on Hydra,
we know that it hasn’t been fixed yet. So the fix consists in opening the
`pkgs/development/r-modules/default.nix` and add the following line:

```
SuperGauss = [ pkg-config ];
```

in either the lists `packagesWithBuildInputs` or `packagesWithNativeBuildInputs`
(as explained above, it doesn’t really matter). Trying to rebuild `SuperGauss`
again will result in a new error message. Another dependecy needs to be added:

```
SuperGauss = [ pkg-config fftw.dev ];
```

Then, building succeeds! We can now commit, push, and open a pull request.
Commit messages need to be formatted in a certain way, as per `nixpkgs`
[contributing
guide](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), so:

```
git add .
git commit -m "rPackages.SuperGauss: add dependencies"
```

also, there should only be one commit per fix. So if in the process of fixing a
package you commited several times, you will need to use `git rebase` to squash
all the commits into one. Once you open the pull request, a maintainer will get
pinged, and merge the PR if everything is alright (which is usually the case for
these one-liners). You can see the PR for `{SuperGauss}`
[here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/287209).

The process is relatively simple once you did it once or twice, but there are
some issues: there is no easy way to find out on which packages we should focus
on. For example, is `{SuperGauss}` really that important? The fix was very
simple, so it’s ok, but if it took more effort, should we spend the limited time
we have on it, or should we focus on another package? Also, if someone has
already opened a PR to fix a package, but that PR hasn’t been merged yet, if I
try to also fix the same package and try to build the package, it would still
fail. So I might think that no one is taking care of it, and waste time
duplicating efforts instead of either focusing on another package, or reviewing
the open PR to accelerate the process of merging.

Discussing this with other contributors, [László
Kupcsik](https://fosstodon.org/deck/@kupac@functional.cafe) suggested we could
use `{packageRank}` to find out which packages are getting a lot of downloads
from CRAN, and so we could focus on fixing these packages first. This is a great
idea and it gave me the idea to build some kind of report that would do this
automatically for us, and also list opened and merged PRs so we wouldn’t risk
duplicating efforts.

This report can be found
[here](https://raw.githack.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/targets-runs/output/r-updates-fails.html)
and now I’ll explain how I built it.

## Which packages to fix and keeping track of PRs

So the main idea was to know on which packages to focus on. So essentially, we
wanted this table:

<div style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="/img/hydra_failing_jobs.jpg" width="80%">
</div>

but with `{packageRank}` added to it. So the first step was to scrape this
table, using `{rvest}`. This is what you can find on lines 11 to 63 of this
[{targets}
workflow](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/blob/0fe273dd234f0d32e5fae86630173ff42cce2d9f/_targets.R)
(alongside some basic cleaning). I won’t go too much into detail, but if
something’s not clear, ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/brodriguesco) or
[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@brodriguesco) or even open an issue on the
report’s
[repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/issues).

Next I also get the reason the package failed building. So in the example from
before, `{AIUQ}` failed because `{SuperGauss}` failed. On Hydra, you should be
clicking to see this, but here I scrape it as well automatically, and add this
information in a column called `fails_because_of`. This is what you can read on
lines
[65 to 77](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/blob/0fe273dd234f0d32e5fae86630173ff42cce2d9f/_targets.R#L65).
I use a function called `safe_get_failed_deps()`, which you can find in the
`functions.R` script [on
here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/blob/0fe273dd234f0d32e5fae86630173ff42cce2d9f/functions.R#L41C1-L68C2).
`safe_get_failed_deps()` wraps the main function, `get_failed_deps()`, with
`tryCatch()`. This is because if anything goes wrong, I want my function
to return `NULL` instead of an error, which would crash the whole pipeline.

Next, I add the packages' rank using a function that wraps
`packageRank::packageRank()` called `safe_packageRank()` on [line 97](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/blob/0fe273dd234f0d32e5fae86630173ff42cce2d9f/_targets.R#L97).

`safe_packageRank()` uses `tryCatch()` to return `NULL` in case there’s an error.
This is needed because `packageRank()` will only work on CRAN packages, but Hydra
also tries to build Bioconductor packages: when these packages’ names get passed
to `packageRank()`, an error gets returned because these are not CRAN packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
packageRank("haha")
Error: haha: misspelled or not on CRAN/Archive.
```

but instead of an error that would stop the pipeline, I prefer it simply returns
`NULL`, hence `tryCatch()`. Also, I compute the rank of the package listed under
the `fails_because_of` column and not the `package` column. If we go back to our
example from before, `{AIUQ}` failed because `{SuperGauss}` failed, I’m actually
interested in the rank of `{SuperGauss}`, and not `{AIUQ}` (which I way I went
to all the trouble to scrape the failing dependency).

So, for now, when comparing to the table on Hydra, we have two further columns
with the dependency that actually fails (or not, if the package fails on its own
and not because of a dependency), and the rank of either the dependency that
fails or the package itself.

Next, I’d like to see if PRs have already been opened and merged. For this, I
use the `gh` tool, which is a command line tool to interact with GitHub
repositories. I wrote the `get_prs()` wrapper around `gh` to list the opened or
the merged PRs of the `nixpkgs` repository. This is what it looks like (and is
defined
[here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/blob/0fe273dd234f0d32e5fae86630173ff42cce2d9f/functions.R#L8C1-L21C2)):

```
get_prs <- function(state){

  output_path <- paste0(state, "_prs.json")

  # Run the command
  system(paste0(
    "gh pr list --state=", state,
    " --search=rPackages -R NixOS/nixpkgs --json title,updatedAt,url > ",
    output_path
  ))

  # Return path for targets
  output_path
}
```

Because the PRs follow the contributing guidelines, I can easily process the PRs
titles to get the name of the package (I essentially need to go from the string
"rPackages.SuperGauss: fixing build" to "SuperGauss") using regular expressions.
This is what happens in the `clean_prs()` function
[here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/blob/0fe273dd234f0d32e5fae86630173ff42cce2d9f/functions.R#L23).

Most of what follows is merging the right data frames and ensuring that I have
something clean to show. Finally, an `.Rmd` document gets compiled, which you
can find
[here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/blob/0fe273dd234f0d32e5fae86630173ff42cce2d9f/r-updates-fails.Rmd).
This will get compiled to an `.html` file which is what you see when you click
[here](https://raw.githack.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/targets-runs/output/r-updates-fails.html).

This runs every day at midnight using GitHub actions ([the workflow is
here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/blob/0fe273dd234f0d32e5fae86630173ff42cce2d9f/.github/workflows/compile_table.yaml))
and then I use the `raw.githack.com` [here](https://raw.githack.com/) to serve
the rendered HTML file. So every time I push, or at midnight, the action runs,
computes the package rank, checks if new PRs are available or have been merged,
and the rendered file is immediately available. How’s that for serverless CI/CD?
