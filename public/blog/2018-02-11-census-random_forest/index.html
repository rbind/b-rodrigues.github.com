				<p>Update 2022: there some literature advising against using techniques to artificially balance a dataset,
   for example
    <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocac093/6605096?searchresult=1&login=false#">one</a>.
   Use at your own risks!</p>

<p>In this blog post, I am going to train a random forest on census data from the US to predict
the probability that someone is looking for a job. To this end, I downloaded the US 1990 census
data from the UCI <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/US+Census+Data+%281990%29">Machine Learning Repository</a>.
Having a background in economics, I am always quite interested by such datasets. I downloaded the raw
data which is around 820mb uncompressed. You can download it from this folder
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census1990-mld/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Before training a random forest on it, some preprocessing is needed. First problem: the columns
in the data do not have names. Actually, training a random forest on unamed variables is possible,
but I like my columns to have names. The names are on a separate file, called <code>USCensus1990raw.attributes.txt</code>.
This is how this file looks like:</p>

<p>The variable names are always written in upper case and sometimes end with some numbers.
Regular expressions will help extract these column names:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

census_raw = import(&quot;USCensus1990raw.data.txt&quot;)

attributes_raw = readLines(&quot;USCensus1990raw.attributes.txt&quot;)

column_names = str_extract_all(attributes_raw, &quot;^[A-Z]+(\\d{1,}|[A-Z])\\s+&quot;) %&gt;%
  flatten %&gt;%
  str_trim %&gt;%
  tolower</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>readLines</code> I load this text file into R. Then with <code>stringr::str_extract_all</code>, I can extract
the variable names from this text file. The regular expression, <code>^[A-Z]+(\\d{1,}|[A-Z])\\s+</code> can
seem complicated, but by breaking it up, it’ll be clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>^[A-Z]+</code>: matches one or more uppercase letter, at the beginning of the line (hence the <code>^</code>)</li>
<li><code>\\d{1,}</code>: matches one or more digits</li>
<li><code>[A-Z]\\s+</code>: matches one uppercase letter, followed by one or more spaces</li>
<li><code>(\\d{1,}|[A-Z])\\s+</code>: matches one or more digits OR (the <code>|</code>) matches one uppercase letter, followed by one or more spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>This regular expression matches only the variable names. By using <code>^</code> I only limit myself to the
uppercase letters at the start of the line, which already removes a lot of unneeded lines from the
text. Then, by matching numbers or letters, followed by spaces, I avoid matching strings such as
<code>VAR:</code>. There’s probably a shorter way to write this regular expression, but since this one works,
I stopped looking for another solution.</p>
<p>Now that I have a vector called <code>column_names</code>, I can baptize the columns in my dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>colnames(census_raw) &lt;- column_names</code></pre>
<p>I also add a column called <code>caseid</code> to the dataset, but it’s actually not really needed. But it
made me look for and find <code>rownames_to_column()</code>, which can be useful:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>census = census_raw %&gt;%
  rownames_to_column(&quot;caseid&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now I select the variables I need. I use <code>dplyr::select()</code> to select the columns I need (actually,
I will remove some of these later for the purposes of the blog post, but will continue exploring
them. Maybe write a part 2?):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>census %&lt;&gt;%
  select(caseid, age, citizen, class, disabl1, disabl2, lang1, looking, fertil, hour89, hours, immigr,
         industry, means, occup, powpuma, powstate, pwgt1, race, ragechld, rearning,
         relat1, relat2, remplpar, rlabor, rpincome, rpob, rspouse, rvetserv, school, sex, tmpabsnt,
         travtime, week89, work89, worklwk, yearsch, yearwrk, yrsserv)</code></pre>
<p>Now, I convert factor variables to factors and only relevel the <code>race</code> variable:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>census %&lt;&gt;%
  mutate(race = case_when(race == 1 ~ &quot;white&quot;,
                          race == 2 ~ &quot;black&quot;,
                          !(race %in% c(1, 2)) ~ &quot;other&quot;,
                          is.na(race) ~ NA_character_)) %&gt;%
  filter(looking != 0) %&gt;%
  mutate_at(vars(class, disabl1, disabl2, lang1, looking, fertil, immigr, industry, means,
                 occup, powstate, race, ragechld, remplpar, rlabor, rpob, rspouse,
                 rvetserv, school, sex, tmpabsnt, work89, worklwk, yearwrk),
            as.factor) %&gt;%
  select(looking, age, class, disabl1, disabl2, lang1, fertil, immigr,
         race, ragechld, remplpar, rlabor, rpob, rspouse,
         rvetserv, school, sex, tmpabsnt, work89, worklwk, yearwrk, rpincome, rearning,
         travtime, week89, work89, hours, yearsch, yrsserv) %&gt;%
  as_tibble

export(census, &quot;regression_data.rds&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>So the variable I want to predict is <code>looking</code> which has 2 levels (I removed the level <code>0</code>, which
stands for <code>NA</code>). I convert all the variables that are supposed to be factors into factors using
<code>mutate_at()</code> and then reselect a subsample of the columns. <code>census</code> is now a tibble with 39
columns and 2458285 rows. I will train the forest on a subsample only, because with cross validation
it would take forever on the whole dataset.</p>
<p>I run the training on another script, that I will then run using the <code>Rscript</code> command instead of
running it from Spacemacs (yes, I don’t use RStudio at home but Spacemacs + ESS). Here’s the script:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(caret)
library(doParallel)
library(rio)

reg_data = import(&quot;regression_data.rds&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>janitor::tabyl(reg_data$looking)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>reg_data$looking      n   percent
1                1  75792 0.1089562
2                2 619827 0.8910438</code></pre>
<p>90% of the individuals in the sample are not looking for a new job. For training purposes, I will
only use 50000 observations instead of the whole sample. I’m already thinking about writing another
blog post where I show how to use the whole data. But 50000 observations should be more than enough
to have a pretty nice model. However, having 90% of observations belonging to a single class can
cause problems with the model; the model might predict that everyone should belong to class 2 and in
doing so, the model would be 90% accurate! Let’s ignore this for now, but later I am going to
tackle this issue with a procedure calleds SMOTE.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)
sample_df = sample_n(reg_data, 50000)</code></pre>
<p>Now, using <code>caret::trainIndex()</code>, I partition the data into a training sample and a testing
sample:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>trainIndex = createDataPartition(sample_df$looking, p = 0.8,
                                 list = FALSE,
                                 times = 1)

train_data = sample_df[trainIndex, ]
test_data = sample_df[-trainIndex, ]</code></pre>
<p>I also save the testing data to disk, because when the training is done I’ll lose my R session
(remember, I’ll run the training using Rscript):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>saveRDS(test_data, &quot;test_data.rds&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Before training the model, I’ll change some options; I’ll do 5-fold cross validation that I repeat
5 times. This will further split the training set into training/testing sets which will increase
my confidence in the metrics that I get from the training. This will ensure that the best model
really is the best, and not a fluke resulting from the splitting of the data that I did beforehand.
Then, I will test the best model on the testing data from above:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fitControl &lt;- trainControl(
  method = &quot;repeatedcv&quot;,
  number = 5,
  repeats = 5)</code></pre>
<p>A very nice feature from the <code>caret</code> package is the possibility to make the training in parallel.
For this, load the <code>doParallel</code> package (which I did above), and then register the number of cores
you want to use for training with <code>makeCluster()</code>. You can replace <code>detectCores()</code> by the number of
cores you want to use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cl = makeCluster(detectCores())
registerDoParallel(cl)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we can train the model:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fit_caret = train(looking ~ .,
                  data = train_data,
                  trainControl = fitControl)</code></pre>
<p>Because it takes around 1 and a half hours to train, I save the model to disk using <code>saveRDS()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>saveRDS(fit_caret, &quot;model_unbalanced.rds&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The picture below shows all the cores from my computer running and RAM usage being around 20gb during
the training process:</p>
<p><img src="/img/training_cpu.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>And this the results of training the random forest on the unbalanced data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>model_unbalanced = readRDS(&quot;model_unbalanced.rds&quot;)

test_data = readRDS(&quot;test_data.rds&quot;)

plot(model_unbalanced)

preds = predict.train(model_unbalanced, newdata = test_data)

<p>If someone really is looking for a job, the model is able to predict it correctly 92% of the times
and 98% of the times if that person is not looking for a job. It’s slightly better than simply saying
than no one is looking for a job, which would be right 90% of the times, but not great either.</p>
<p>To train to make the model more accurate in predicting class 1, I will resample the training set, but by
downsampling class 2 and upsampling class 1. This can be done with the function <code>SMOTE()</code> from the
<code>{DMwR}</code> package. However, the testing set should have the same distribution as the population,
so I should not apply <code>SMOTE()</code> to the testing set. I will resplit the data, but this time with a 95/5 % percent
split; this way I have 5% of the original dataset used for testing, I can use <code>SMOTE()</code> on the
95% remaining training set. Because <code>SMOTE</code>ing takes some time, I save the <em>SMOTE</em>d training set
using <code>readRDS()</code> for later use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reg_data = import(&quot;regression_data.rds&quot;)

<p>The balanced accuracy is higher, but unlike what I expected (and hoped), this model is worse in
predicting class 1! I will be trying one last thing; since I have a lot of data at my disposal,
I will simply sample 25000 observations where the target variable <code>looking</code> equals 1, and then sample
another 25000 observations where the target variable equals 2 (without using <code>SMOTE()</code>). Then I’ll
simply bind the rows and train the model on that:</p>

<p>Looks like it’s not much better than using <code>SMOTE()</code>!</p>
<p>There are several ways I could achieve better predictions; tuning the model is one possibility,
or perhaps going with another type of model altogether. I will certainly come back to this dataset
in future blog posts!</p>
<p>Using the best model, let’s take a look at which variables are the most important for predicting job search:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; varImp(model_unbalanced)
rf variable importance

only 20 most important variables shown (out of 109)

Overall
rlabor3   100.0000
rlabor6    35.2702
age         6.3758
rpincome    6.2964
tmpabsnt1   5.8047
rearning    5.3560
week89      5.2863
tmpabsnt2   4.0195
yearsch     3.4892
tmpabsnt3   1.7434
work892     1.3231
racewhite   0.9002
class1      0.7866
school2     0.7117
yearwrk2    0.6970
sex1        0.6955
disabl12    0.6809
lang12      0.6619
rpob23      0.6507
rspouse6    0.6330</code></pre>
<p>It’s also possible to have a plot of the above:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(varImp(model_unbalanced))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/img/varimp.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>To make sense of this, we have to read the description of the features <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census1990-mld/USCensus1990raw.attributes.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p><code>rlabor3</code> is the most important variable, and means that the individual is unemployed. <code>rlabor6</code>
means not in the labour force. Then the age of the individual as well as the individual’s income
play a role. <code>tmpabsnt</code> is a variable that equals 1 if the individual is temporary absent from work,
due to a layoff. All these variables having an influence on the probability of looking
for a job make sense, but looks like a very simple model focusing on just a couple of variables
would make as good a job as the random forest.</p>
