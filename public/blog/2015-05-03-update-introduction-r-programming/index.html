<p>This semester I taught a course on applied econometrics with the R programming language. For this, I created a document that I gave to my students and shared online. This is the kind of document I would have liked to read when I first started using R. I already had some programming experience in C and Pascal but this is not necessarily the case for everyone that is confronted to R when they start learning about econometrics.</p>

<p>This is why the beginning of the document focuses more on general programming knowledge and techniques, and then only on econometrics. People online seemed to like the document, as I&rsquo;ve received some positive comments by David Smith from Revolution R (read his blog post about the document <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/01/introduction-to-applied-econometrics-with-r.html">here</a>) and Dave Giles which links to David&rsquo;s blog post <a href="http://davegiles.blogspot.fr/2015/04/introduction-to-applied-econometrics.html?spref=tw">here</a>. People on twitter have also retweeted David&rsquo;s and Dave&rsquo;s tweets to their blog posts and I&rsquo;ve received some requests by people to send them the PDF by email (because they live in places where Dropbox is not accessible unfortunately).</p>

<p>The document is still a work in progress (and will probably remain so for a long time), but I&rsquo;ve added some new sections about reproducible research and thought that this update could warrant a new blog post.</p>

<p>For now, only linear models are reviewed, but I think I&rsquo;ll start adding some chapters about non-linear models soonish. The goal for these notes, however, is not to re-invent the wheel: there are lots of good books about econometrics with R out there and packages that estimate a very wide range of models. What I want for these notes, is to focus more on the programming knowledge an econometrician needs, in a very broad and general sense. I want my students to understand that R is a true programming language, and that they need to use every feature offered by such a language, and not think of R as a black box into which you only type pre-programmed commands, but also be able to program their own routines.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve made it possible to create the PDF using a Makefile. This may be useful for people that do not have access to Dropbox, but are familiar with git.</p>

<p>You can compile the book in two ways: first download the whole repository:</p>

<p><code>git clone git@bitbucket.org:b-rodrigues/programmingeconometrics.git</code></p>

<p>and then, with Rstudio, open the file <em>appliedEconometrics.Rnw</em> and knit it. Another solution is to use the Makefile. Just type:</p>

<p><code>make</code></p>

<p>inside a terminal (should work on GNU+Linux and OSX systems) and it should compile the document. You may get some message about &ldquo;additional information&rdquo; for some R packages. When these come up, just press Q on your keyboard to continue the compilation process.</p>

<p>Get the notes <a href="https://cloud.openmailbox.org/index.php/s/ghZwBxMb24tWGSL">here</a>.</p>

<p>As always, if you have questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to send me an  <a href="mailto:contact@brodrigues.co">email</a> and I sure hope you&rsquo;ll find these notes useful!</p>
