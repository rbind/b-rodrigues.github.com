</div>
<p>UPDATE: I’ve update this blog post on the 30 of June 2023. I corrected a statement
where I said that the <code>_quarto.yml</code> file is where you can choose the version of R
to compile the book. That’s wrong, choosing the version of R to compile the book
is done on the Github Actions workflow. I’ve also added some answers to questions
I got on social media.</p>
<p>So I’ve recently self-published a book on both
<a href="https://leanpub.com/raps-with-r/">Leanpub</a> as an Ebook and
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C87H6MGF">Amazon</a> as a <em>physical</em> book and thought
that it would be worth it to write down how to do it. I’ve wasted some time
getting everything to work flawlessly so if you’re looking for a guide on how to
create both an ebook and a print-ready PDF for Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing
service using Quarto, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to waste time reading, <a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/kdp_quarto">just fork this
repo</a> and use that as a starting
point. Each time you push a change to the repo, a website, Epub and PDF get
generated using Github Actions. If you want to understand the details, read on.</p>
<div id="your-books-dependencies" class="section level2">
<h2>Your book’s dependencies</h2>
<p>You should start by creating an <code>renv.lock</code> file. This file will list all the
dependencies of your book. For example, if you’re using <code>{ggplot2}</code> to make
graphs or <code>{flextable}</code> for tables, the <code>renv.lock</code> file will list them and then
this file will be used to download the required packages by Github Actions (more
on Github Actions later) to create the book. The template comes with one such
<code>renv.lock</code> file, but you should generate one specific to your project. Simply
install <code>{renv}</code> and run:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>renv::init()</code></pre>
<p>Answer “Y” to the question and wait a little. The <code>renv.lock</code> file should appear
alongside the source of your book now. If you need to install more packages to
keep writing your book, install them as usual (using
<code>install.packages("package")</code>) but then don’t forget to create a new <code>renv.lock</code>
file using <code>renv::snapshot()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="quarto.yml" class="section level2">
<h2>_quarto.yml</h2>
<p>Whatever output format, everything gets defined in the <code>_quarto.yml</code> file in the
root directory of your book. This file is where you can choose which themes to
use for your website for example, which output formats you want to compile your
book into, etc. I’ll discuss each option for each format below.</p>
</div>
<div id="generating-the-website" class="section level2">
<h2>Generating the website</h2>
<p>I’m using Github Actions to generate each format of the book. Github Actions is
essentially a computer hosted by Github that you can use to run arbitrary
commands. These commands must be written in a specific file which must be put in
a specific place in your repository.
<a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/kdp_quarto/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_book.yml">Here</a>
is that file for the repo I linked above. I won’t go into details because I’ve
explained how Github Actions works
<a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2022-11-19-raps/">here</a> already, but you’ll notice
that you can choose a version of R to compile your document and also a different
version of Quarto. This can be useful for reproducibility.</p>
<p>Create a new branch called <code>gh-pages</code> and then go to settings, then on the
side-bar on the left choose “Actions”, and scroll down. Then, in “Workflow
persmissions”, check “Read and Write permissions” and “Allow Github Actions to
create and approve pull requests”. Then go to “Pages” which you can find on the
side-bar on the left, and choose “Deploy from a branch” under “Build and
deployment” and choose “gh-pages” and “root”:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="/img/github_pages.png" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>Each time you push, the website to your book will get updated. Here are the options
I chose for my website, which you can find in the <code>_quarto.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>html:
   theme:
     light: flatly
     dark: solar
   css:
     epub.css</code></pre>
<p>So my website is available in two themes, a dark and light one. I highly
recommend you also provide two themes. You can also provide a <code>.css</code> file to
customize the appearance of you website, and of your ebook (that’s because an
Epub is actually a bunch of html files). The <code>.css</code> I’m using is quite simple,
the only thing it’s doing is making sure that images won’t be wider than the
web-page. You can view the website of this template book
<a href="https://b-rodrigues.github.io/kdp_quarto/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="generating-an-ebook" class="section level2">
<h2>Generating an Ebook</h2>
<p>Let’s continue with the <code>.epub</code> format. This is an Ebook format that can be read
on E-readers such as the Kindle from Amazon. If you want to sell an Ebook on
Leanpub (or send it to your Kindle), it needs to pass a tool called <code>epubcheck</code>.</p>
<p>I’ve already written about generating ebooks in the past
(<a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2023-03-03-quarto_books/">here</a>). However, the
advice in that blog post was only valid because there were bugs in the version
of Quarto that was current at the time and so I showed some workarounds. With
the current version, no workarounds are needed anymore, Epubs generated by
Quarto now pass <code>epubcheck</code>. Check the source, specifically <code>index.qmd</code> to see
how I include graphics.</p>
</div>
<div id="generating-a-print-ready-pdf" class="section level2">
<h2>Generating a print-ready PDF</h2>
<p>This was the hardest part: I’m using Amazon’s KDP service to sell physical
copies of the book and the PDF needs to be in a specific format. I’m using the 6
x 9 format without bleed, which seems to be the most common. If you look again
at the <code>_quarto.yml</code> file, you should see this:</p>
<pre><code>  pdf:
    keep-tex: true
    documentclass: scrbook
    classoption: [paper=6in:9in,pagesize=pdftex,headinclude=on,footinclude=on,12pt]
    include-in-header:
      text: |
        \usepackage{fvextra}
        \DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Highlighting}{Verbatim}{breaklines,commandchars=\\\{\}}
        \areaset[0.50in]{4.5in}{8in}
    include-before-body:
      text: |
        \RecustomVerbatimEnvironment{verbatim}{Verbatim}{
           showspaces = false,
           showtabs = false,
           breaksymbolleft={},
           breaklines
           % Note: setting commandchars=\\\{\} here will cause an error 
        }
    fig-pos: &#39;H&#39;</code></pre>
<p>What’s important is ‘classoption’:</p>
<pre><code>classoption: [paper=6in:9in,pagesize=pdftex,headinclude=on,footinclude=on,12pt]</code></pre>
<p>This is where I can choose the dimensions of the book (6 x 9) and the size of the font (12pt).
Then:</p>
<pre><code>include-in-header:
  text: |
    \usepackage{fvextra}
    \DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Highlighting}{Verbatim}{breaklines,commandchars=\\\{\}}
    \areaset[0.50in]{4.5in}{8in}</code></pre>
<p>With <code>fvextra</code> and the call to <code>\DefineVerbatimEnvironment</code> I make sure that long lines of code
get wrapped in the PDF. Without this, long lines of code would simply continue outside the margins
of the PDF, and Amazon’s KDP doesn’t accept a PDF like this.</p>
<p><code>\areaset[0.50in]{4.5in}{8in}</code>: this is the area that well be used for writing. These are the correct
dimensions for a 6 by 9 book without bleed. Then, I keep customizing the <code>verbatim</code> environment:</p>
<pre><code>include-before-body:
  text: |
    \RecustomVerbatimEnvironment{verbatim}{Verbatim}{
       showspaces = false,
       showtabs = false,
       breaksymbolleft={},
       breaklines
       % Note: setting commandchars=\\\{\} here will cause an error 
    }</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the last option:</p>
<pre><code>fig-pos: &#39;H&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This ensures that the figures are placed EXACTLY where you say they should be in
the final PDF. For those of you that use LaTeX, you know that LaTeX sometimes
takes some liberties with figure placement. I’ve been told the lie that LaTeX
knows where to place the figures perfectly well many times but I don’t buy
it. So use <code>fig-pos: 'H'</code> to avoid lots of frustration.</p>
<p>That’s it! You should now be able to generate a book that is print-ready, and
an Epub that passes <code>epubcheck</code> as well as website. You can now just focus
on writing. Also check the source of <code>index.qmd</code> for to see how to include text
in the PDF only (or not show text in the PDF).</p>

<div id="my-personal-experience-and-some-faq" class="section level2">
<h2>My personal experience and some FAQ</h2>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed using both Leanpub and Amazon to publish my book. Leanpub is
really nice, because they really offer a very nice deal: you get 80% of the
sales price as royalties, which is the highest share I’ve seen. Also the people
working there are really nice, I’ve had the chance to discuss with Len Epp,
Leanpub’s cofounder, in his <a href="https://youtu.be/aXfjhf2cDo0">Frontmatter podcast</a>
and would definitely continue using their platform in the future. Regarding
Amazon I must say that the experience was quite good as well; the only friction
I had was getting the PDF in the right format for printing, but that’s hardly
something that Amazon can be blamed for. After all if the PDF’s formatting is
bad, the books will look like crap as well. One thing you should know though is
that you need to get a VAT number to sell books on Amazon. I live in Luxembourg
and getting one is trivial, but in other countries this may be more complex. You
should know as well that Leanpub can sell the physical copies of your book,
through Amazon, for you. They essentially act as a publisher then. This way, you
don’t need to get a VAT number, if that’s difficult for you. But you’ll need to
share the Amazon royalties with Leanpub.</p>
<p>When publishing a book through Amazon’s KDP service, you also get access to a
basic book cover editor that you can use to create a cover for your book. You
can provide an image and then use the editor to create the cover, but you can
also provide a ready-made cover if you have the talent to make one using an
image editing software. Once you’re done, and click “Publish” on Amazon, the
book will get reviewed by a human. This process can take up to three days, but
in my case it took only 4 to 6 hours. However, my book was rejected, twice. One
time was because one of the images I used in the book had colour bars in the
bottom right corner, that I needed to remove, and the other time was because the
“g” in my name, “Rodrigues” was cut by the cover editor and it was hard to tell
if it was a “g” or a “q”. Once I corrected both issues, the book was available
for order on Amazon.com within the day. The other marketplaces, like France and
Germany took one day more, and the UK marketplace took 4 days.</p>
