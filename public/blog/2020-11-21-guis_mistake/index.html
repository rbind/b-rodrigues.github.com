<p>Some weeks ago I tweeted this:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

GUIs were a mistake
</p>
— Bruno Rodrigues (<span class="citation">@brodriguesco</span>) <a href="https://twitter.com/brodriguesco/status/1314505586172624898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2020</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>you might think that I tweeted this as an unfunny joke, but it’s not. GUIs were one of the worst
things to happen for statisticians. Clickable interfaces for data analysis is probably one of the
greatest source of mistakes and errors in data processing, very likely costing many millions to
companies worldwide and is a source of constant embarassment when mistakes happen which cost the
reputation, and money, of institutions or people.</p>
<p>Remember the infamous Excel mistake by Reinhard and Rogoff? If you don’t know what I’m
talking about, you can get up to speed by reading <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646">this</a>.
I think the most interesting sentence is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most serious was that, in their Excel spreadsheet, Reinhart and Rogoff had not selected the entire row when averaging growth figures: they omitted data from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Denmark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a typical mistake that happens when a mouse is used to select data in a GUI, instead of
typing whatever you need in a scripting language. Many other mistakes like that happen, and they
remain hidden, potentially for years, or go unreported.</p>
<p>Recently there was another Excel-related problem in England where positive Covid tests got lost. For some
obscure reason, the raw data, which was encoded in a CSV file, got converted into an Excel
spreadsheet, most likely for further analysis. The problem is that the format that was used was the
now obsolete XLS format, instead of the latest XLSX format, which can handle millions of rows.
Because the data was converted in the XLS format, up to 15841 cases were lost. You can get all the
details from this BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988">article</a>. Again, not entirely
Excel’s fault, as it was misused. The problem is that when all you have is a hammer, everything
looks like a nail, and Excel is that data analytics hammer. So to the uncultured, everything
looks like an Excel problem.</p>
<p>Now don’t misunderstand me; I’m not blaming Excel specifically, or any other specific GUI
application for this. In many cases, the problem lies between the keyboard and the chair. But GUI
applications have a part of responsibility, as they allow users to implement GUI-based workflows. I
think that complex GUI based workflows were an unintended consequence of developing GUIs. Who could
have expected, 40 years ago, that office jobs would evolve so much and that they would require such
complex workflows to generate an output? Consider the life-cycle of a shared Excel file in your
typical run-of-the-mill financial advisory firm. In many cases, it starts with an already existing
file that was made for another client and that is now used as a starting point. The first thing to
do, is to assign a poor junior to update the file and adapt it for the current assignment. He or
she will spend hours trying to reverse engineer this Excel file and then update it. This file
will at some point go to more senior members that will continue working on it, until it gets send
off for review to a manager. This manager, already overworked and with little time between meetings
to review the file correctly, just gives it a cursory glance and might find some mistakes here and
there. As a review method, colours and comments will be used.
The file goes back for a round of updates and reviews. As time goes by, and as the file gets
more and more complex, it starts to become impossible to manage and review properly. It eventually
gets used to give advice to a client, which might be totally wrong, because just as in the case of Reinhard and
Rogoff, someone, at some point, somewhere, did not select the right cells for the right formula.
Good luck ever finding this mistake, and who did it. During my consulting years, I have been
involved with very, very, big clients that were completely overwhelmed because all their
workflows were GUI based. They had been working like that for years, and kept recruiting highly
educated people en masse just to manage Excel and Word files. They were looking for a magic,
AI-based solution, because in their minds, if AIs could drive fricking cars, they should
also be able to edit and send Excel files around for review. Well, we’re not quite there yet,
so we told them, after our review of their processes and data sources (which in many
cases were Excel AND Word files), that what they needed was for their
company to go through an in-depth optimisation process “journey”. They weren’t interested
so they kept hiring very intelligent people to be office drones. I don’t think
that business model can remain sustainable.</p>
<p>Now how much are situations like that the fault of Excel and how much personal responsibility do the
people involved have? I don’t know, but my point is that if, by magic, GUIs were
made to disappear, problems like that would also not exist. The reason is that if
you’re forced to write code to reach the results you want, you avoid a lot of these pitfalls
I just described. Working with scripts and the command line forces a discipline unto
you; you cannot be lazy and click around.
For example, reverse engineering a source code file is much easier that a finished
Excel spreadsheet. Even poorly written and undocumented code is always much better
than an Excel spreadsheet. If you throw a version control system in the mix, you have
the whole history of the file and the ability to know exactly what happened and when.
Add unit tests on the pile, and you start to get something that is very robust,
transparent, and much easier to audit.</p>
<p>“But Bruno, not everyone is a programmer!” I hear you scream at your monitor.</p>
<p>My point, again, is that if GUIs did not exist, people would have enough knowledge of these
tools to be able to work. What other choice would they have?</p>
<p>Of course, GUIs have been invented, and they’re going nowhere. So what can you do?</p>
<p>When it comes to statistics and data analysis/processing, you can at least not be part of the
problem and avoid using Excel altogether. If we go back to our previous scenario from the financial
advisory firm, the first step, which consisted in reverse engineering an Excel file, can be done
using <code>{tidyxl}</code>. Let’s take a quick look; the spreadsheet I used as the header image for this blog
post comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_Corpus">Enron corpus</a> , which is mostly
know for being a database of over 600000 emails from the US company Enron. But it also contains
spreadsheets, which are delightful. You can download the one from the picture
<a href="https://github.com/rbind/b-rodrigues.github.com/raw/master/dutch_quigley__9378__modeldutch.xlsx">here</a>
(8mb xlsx warning). Opening it in your usual spreadsheet application will probably cause your heart
rate to increase to dangerous levels, so avoid that. Instead, let’s take a look at what <code>{tidyxl}</code>
does with it:</p>

<p>That whole Excel workbook is inside a neat data frame. Imagine that you want
to quickly know where all the formulas are:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dutch_quigley_9378 %&gt;%

<p>With the code above, you can quickly find, for each sheet, where the formulas
are. This workbook contains 18776 formulas. If Hell is a real place, it’s probably
an office building full of cubicles where you’ll sit for eternity looking
at these spreadsheets and trying to make sense of them.</p>
<p>Now imagine that you’d like to know what these formulas are, let’s say, for the
<code>Swap</code> sheet:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dutch_quigley_9378 %&gt;%
  filter(sheet == &quot;Swap&quot;, !is.na(formula)) %&gt;%
  select(address, formula)</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea. There are many more things that you can extract such as
the formatting, the contents of the cells, the comments (and where to find them)
and much, much more. This will make making sense of a complex Excel file a breeze.</p>
<p>The other thing that you can also do, once you’re done understanding this
monster Excel file, is not to perform the analysis inside Excel. Don’t fall into the temptation of
continuing this bad habit. As one on the data experts in your team/company, you have a
responsibility to bring the light to your colleagues. Be their Prometheus and decouple the data
from the code. Let the data be in Excel, but write all the required code to create whatever is
expected from you inside R. You can then export your finalized results back to Excel if needed. If
management tells you to do it in Excel, tell them that you’re the professional statistician/data
scientist, and that they shouldn’t tell you how to do your job. Granted, this is not always
possible, but you should plead your case as much as possible. In general, a good manager will be
all ears if you explain that not using GUIs like Excel makes it easier to spot and correct
mistakes, with the added benefit of being much easily audited and with huge time savings in the
long run. This is of course easier for completely new projects, and if you have an open-minded
manager. If you’re the manager, then you should ask your IT department to uninstall Excel
from your team member’s computers.</p>
<p>Be brave, and ditch the GUI.</p>
