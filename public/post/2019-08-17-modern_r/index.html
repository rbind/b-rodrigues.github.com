<p>Yesterday I released an ebook on <a href="https://leanpub.com/modern_tidyverse">Leanpub</a>,
called <em>Modern R with the tidyverse</em>, which you can also
read for free <a href="https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I want to give some context.</p>
<p><em>Modern R with the tidyverse</em> is the second ebook I release on Leanpub. I released the first one, called
<a href="https://leanpub.com/fput">Functional programming and unit testing for data munging with R</a> around
Christmas 2016 (I’ve retired it on Leanpub, but you can still read it for free
<a href="https://b-rodrigues.github.io/fput/">here</a>) . I just had moved back to my home country of
Luxembourg and started a new job as a research assistant at the statistical national institute.
Since then, lots of things happened; I’ve changed jobs and joined PwC Luxembourg as a data scientist,
was promoted to manager, finished my PhD, and most importantly of all, I became a father.</p>
<p>Through all this, I continued blogging and working on a new ebook, called <em>Modern R with the tidyverse</em>.
At first, this was supposed to be a separate book from the first one, but as I continued writing,
I realized that updating and finishing the first one, would take a lot of effort, and also, that
it wouldn’t make much sense in keeping both separated. So I decided to merge the content from the
first ebook with the second, and update everything in one go.</p>
<p>My very first notes were around 50 pages if memory serves, and I used them to teach R at the
University of Strasbourg while I employed there as a research and teaching assistant and working
on my PhD. These notes were the basis of <em>Functional programming and unit testing for data munging with R</em>
and now <em>Modern R</em>. Chapter 2 of <em>Modern R</em> is almost a simple copy and paste from these notes
(with more sections added). These notes were first written around 2012-2013ish.</p>
<p><em>Modern R</em> is the kind of text I would like to have had when I first started playing around with R,
sometime around 2009-2010. It starts from the beginning, but also goes quite into details in the
later chapters. For instance, the section on
<a href="https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/functional-programming.html#modeling-with-functional-programming">modeling with functional programming</a>
is quite advanced, but I believe that readers that read through all the book and reached that part
would be armed with all the needed knowledge to follow. At least, this is my hope.</p>
<p>Now, the book is still not finished. Two chapters are missing, but it should not take me long to
finish them as I already have drafts lying around. However, exercises might still be in wrong
places, and more are required. Also, generally, more polishing is needed.</p>
<p>As written in the first paragraph of this section, the book is available on
<a href="https://leanpub.com/modern_tidyverse">Leanpub</a>. Unlike my previous ebook, this one costs money;
a minimum price of 4.99$ and a recommended price of 14.99$, but as mentioned you can read it for
free <a href="https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/">online</a>. I’ve hesitated to give it a minimum price of
0$, but I figured that since the book can be read for free online, and that Leanpub has a 45 days
return policy where readers can get 100% reimbursed, no questions asked (and keep the downloaded
ebook), readers were not taking a lot of risks by buying it for 5 bucks. I sure hope however that
readers will find that this ebook is worth at least 5 bucks!</p>
<p>Now why should you read it? There’s already a lot of books on learning how to use R. Well, I don’t
really want to convince you to read it. But some people do seem to like my style of writing and my
blog posts, so I guess these same people, or similar people, might like the ebook. Also, I think
that this ebook covers a lot of different topics, enough of them to make you an efficient R user.
But as I’ve written in the introduction of <em>Modern R</em>:</p>
<p><em>So what you can expect from this book is that this book is not the only one you should read.</em></p>
<p>Anyways, hope you’ll enjoy <em>Modern R</em>, suggestions, criticisms and reviews welcome!</p>
<p>By the way, the cover of the book is a painting by John William Waterhouse, depicting Diogenes of Sinope,
an ancient Greek philosopher, and absolute mad lad. Read his Wikipedia page, it’s worth it.</p>
