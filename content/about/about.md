My name is Bruno Rodrigues and hold a PhD in Economics from the 
[University of Strasbourg](http://www.unistra.fr).

I'm currently employed as a statistician for the Ministry of Higher Education and Research in 
Luxembourg. Before that I was senior data scientist and then manager in the data science team 
at PwC Luxembourg, and before that I was a research assistant at [STATEC Research](http://www.statistiques.public.lu/en/actors/statec/organisation/red/).

My hobbies are boxing, lifting weights, cycling, cooking and reading or listening to audiobooks, 
which is more compatible with the life of a young father.
I also enjoy learning about the R programming language and sharing my knowledge.
That's why I made this blog and also am writing an [ebook](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/).
I also have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZXht1RTL2Duc3eU8MYGzQ), 
where I show some tips and tricks with R, or rant about stuff.
