Hi! My name is Bruno Rodrigues, and I'm a statistician at the Ministry of Higher Education and Research
in Luxembourg.

I'm an economist by training and hold a PhD from the University of Strasbourg, 
but am interested in any subject that deals with statistics and machine learning in general.

I program mostly in R and love sharing my knowledge, that's why I started this blog.
I share my posts also on [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com) and [Rweekly](https://rweekly.org). 
In my posts, I discuss new packages I discovered or new ways of using packages.
 
I also have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BrunoRodrigues1988) for those of you
that prefer watching videos instead of reading.

If you find this blog useful, you might want to follow 
me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/brodriguesco) for blog post updates and 
[buy me an espresso](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/brodriguesco) or [paypal.me](https://www.paypal.me/brodriguesco).

I wrote an ebook called *Modern R with the tidyverse* that you can read for free
[here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/).
If you find it useful and want to contribute to this blog and future ebooks, you can also
purchase a copy on [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/modern_tidyverse).
This ebook is partly based of my [old one](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/fput/).

You can also download my package, called [{brotools}](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/brotools),
which contains some functions I use daily. You might find them useful too! I also made a package
called `{nethack}` that contains data from NetHack games played online from 2001 to 2018. You
can get it [here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nethack). I also made another package, 
[{michelRodange}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/michelRodange/index.html), which contains
texts written by the Luxembourguish author Michel Rodange, that can be used for text mining.
