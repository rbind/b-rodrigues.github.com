This semester, I'll be teaching an introduction to applied econometrics with R, so I've decided to write a very small book called "Introduction to programming Econometrics with R". This is primarily intended for bachelor students and the focus is not much on econometric theory, but more on how to implement econometric theory into computer code, using the R programming language. It's very basic and doesn't cover any advanced topics in econometrics and is intended for people with 0 previous programming knowledge. It is still very rough around the edges, and it's missing the last chapter about reproducible research, and the references, but I think it's time to put it out there; someone else than my students may find it useful. The book's probably full of typos and mistakes, so don't hesitate to drop me an e-mail if you find something fishy: 
contact@brodrigues.co

Also there might be some sections at the beginning that only concern my students. Just ignore that.

### Update (2017-01-22)

You might find the book useful as it is now, but I never had a chance to finish it. I might get back to
it once I'll have more time, and port it to bookdown.
