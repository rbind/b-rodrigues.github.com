<p>Data scientists, statisticians, analysts, researchers, and many other
professionals write <em>a lot of code</em>.</p>
<p>Not only do they write a lot of code, but they must also read and review a lot
of code as well. They either work in teams and need to review each other’s code,
or need to be able to reproduce results from past projects, be it for peer
review or auditing purposes. And yet, they never, or very rarely, get taught
the tools and techniques that would make the process of writing, collaborating,
reviewing and reproducing projects possible.</p>
<p>Which is truly unfortunate because software engineers face the same challenges
and solved them decades ago. Software engineers developed a set of project
management techniques and tools that non-programmers who write a lot of code
could benefit from as well.</p>
<p>These tools and techniques can be used right from the start of a project at a
minimal cost, such that the analysis is well-tested, well-documented,
trustworthy and reproducible <em>by design</em>. Projects are going to be reproducible
simply because they were engineered, from the start, to be reproducible.</p>
<p>But all these tools, frameworks and techniques boil down to two acronyms that I
like to keep in my head at all times:</p>
<ul>
<li>DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself;</li>
<li>WIT: Write It Down.</li>
</ul>
<p>DRY WIT: by systematically avoiding not to repeat yourself and
by writing everything down, projects become well-tested, well-documented,
trustworthy and reproducible by design. Why is that?</p>
<div id="dry-dont-repeat-yourself" class="section level2">
<h2>DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself</h2>
<p>Let’s start with DRY: what does it mean not having to repeat oneself? It means:</p>
<ul>
<li>using functions instead of copy-and-pasting bits of code here and there;</li>
<li>using literate programming, to avoid having to copy and paste graphs and tables into
word or pdf documents;</li>
<li>treating code as data and making use of templating.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most widely used programming languages for data science/statistics, Python and R,
both have first-class functions. This means that functions can be manipulated like
any other object. So something like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Reduce(`+`, seq(1:100))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5050</code></pre>
<p>where the function <code>+</code>() gets used as an argument of the higher-order <code>Reduce()</code>
function is absolutely valid (and so is Python’s equivalent <code>reduce</code> from
<code>functools</code>) and avoids having to use a for-loop which can lead to other issues.
Generally speaking, the functional programming paradigm lends itself very
naturally to data analysis tasks, and in my opinion data scientists and
statisticians would benefit a lot from adopting this paradigm.</p>
<p>Literate programming is another tool that needs to be in the toolbox of
any person analysing data. This is because at the end of the day, the results
of an analysis need to be in some form of document. Without literate programming,
this is how you would draft reports:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rap4all/blob/master/images/report_draft_loop.png?raw=true" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p>But with literate programming, this is how this loop would look like:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rap4all/blob/master/images/md_draft_loop.png?raw=true" width="100%"></p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> is the latest open-source scientific and technical
publishing system that leverages Pandoc and supports R, Python, Julia and
ObservableJs right out of the box.</p>
<p>Below is a little Quarto Hello World:</p>
<pre class="default"><code>---
output: pdf
---

In this example we embed parts of the examples from the
\texttt{kruskal.test} help page into a LaTeX document:

```{r}
data (airquality)
kruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```

which shows that the location parameter of the Ozone
distribution varies significantly from month to month.
Finally we include a boxplot of the data:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```
</code></pre>
<p>Compiling this document results in the following:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>
<p>Of course, you could use Python code chunks instead of R, you could also compile
this document to Word, or HTML, or anything else really. By combining code and
prose, the process of data analysis gets streamlined and we don’t need to repeat
ourselves copy and pasting images and tables into Word documents.</p>
<p>Finally, treating code as data is also quite useful. This means that it is
possible to compute on the language itself. This is a more advanced topic, but
definitely worth the effort. As an illustration, consider the following R toy example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>show_and_eval &lt;- function(f, ...){
  f &lt;- deparse(substitute(f))
  dots &lt;- list(...)
  message(&quot;Evaluating: &quot;, f, &quot;() with arguments: &quot;, deparse(dots))
  do.call(f, dots)
}</code></pre>
<p>Running this function does the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>show_and_eval(sqrt, 2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Evaluating: sqrt() with arguments: list(2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1.414214</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>show_and_eval(mean, x = c(NA, 1, 2))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Evaluating: mean() with arguments: list(x = c(NA, 1, 2))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] NA</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>show_and_eval(mean, x = c(NA, 1, 2), na.rm = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Evaluating: mean() with arguments: list(x = c(NA, 1, 2), na.rm = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1.5</code></pre>
<p>This is incredibly useful when writing packages (to know more about these
techniques in the R programming language, read the chapter <em>Metaprogramming</em> from
<a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/metaprogramming.html">Advanced R</a>).</p>

<div id="wit-write-it-down" class="section level2">
<h2>WIT: Write It Down</h2>
<p>Now on the WIT bit: <em>write it down</em>. You’ve just written a function. To see if
it works correctly, you test it in the interactive console. You execute the
test, see that it works, and move on. But wait! What you just did is called a
unit test. Instead of writing that in the console and then never use it ever
again, write it down in a script. Now you’ve got a unit test for that function
that you can execute each time you update that function’s code, and make sure
that it keeps working as expected. There are many unit testing frameworks that
can help you how to write unit tests consistently and run them automatically.</p>
<p>Documentation: write it down! How does the function work? What are its inputs?
Its outputs? What else should the user know to make it work? Very often,
documentation is but a series of comments in your scripts. That’s already nice,
but using literate programming, you could also turn these comments into proper
documentation. You could use <em>docstrings</em> in Python or <code>{roxygen2}</code> style
comments in R.</p>
<p>Another classic: you correct some data manually in the raw dataset (very often a
<code>.csv</code> or <code>.xlsx</code> file). For example, when dealing with data on people, sex is
sometimes “M” or “F”, sometimes “Male” or “Female”, sometimes “1” or “0”. You
spot a couple of inconsistencies and decide to <em>quickly</em> correct them by hand.
Maybe only 3 men were coded as “Male” so you simply erase the “ale” and go on
with your project. Stop!</p>
<p>Write it down!</p>
<p>Write a couple of lines of code that does the replacement for you. Not only will
this leave a trace, it will ensure that when you get an update to that data in
the future you don’t have to remember to have to change it by hand.</p>
<p>You should aim at completely eliminating any required manual intervention when
building your project. A project that can be fully run by a machine is easier to
debug, its execution can be scheduled and can be iterated over very quickly.</p>
<p>Something else that you should write down, or rather, let another tool do it for
you: how you collaborate with your teammates. For this, you should be using
Git. Who changed what part of what function when? If the project’s code is
versioned, Git writes it down for you. You want to experiment with a new
feature? Write it down by creating a new branch and going nuts. There’s something
wrong in the code? Write it down as an issue on your versioning platform (usually
Github).</p>
<p>There are many more topics that us disciplines of the data could learn from
software engineers. I’m currently working on a free ebook that you can read
<a href="https://raps-with-r.dev/">here</a> that teaches these techniques. If this post
opened your appetite, give the book a go!</p>
