<p>Nix is not only a package manager, but also a build automation tool, and you can
use it to build polyglot data science pipelines in a completely reproducible
way.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that you need to mix Python, R and maybe some others tools
for a project (by the way, some believe this will become the norm in the coming
years, use your favourite search engine to look for “polyglot data science” and
you’ll see), and suppose that you want to define your project as a nice
reproducible pipeline, and not simply a series of scripts. What are the options
available to you?</p>
<p>One option would be to use the <code>{targets}</code> package for R, which allows you to do
lay out your project as pipeline. But as amazing as <code>{targets}</code> is, it only
works with R. If you also need Python, you would then need to also use the
<code>{reticulate}</code> package to interface with it. But what do you do if you need some
other command line tools? Well, you could wrap them in an R function using
<code>system()</code> or <code>system2()</code>. But what if you need yet another language, like
Julia? There might be a way to call Julia from R, but as you see, the more
diverse tools you need, the more complex it gets. And it doesn’t really matter
if you switch from <code>{targets}</code> to another such package that exists for, say,
Python, you would always need to write wrappers or use packages that allow you
to call the other programming languages that you need.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to use good old <code>make</code>. <code>make</code> is a tool from the GNU
project that allows you to define <em>targets</em>, which would be the outputs of a
script or call to some cli tool by writing so-called <code>Makefiles</code>. For an example
of a <code>Makefile</code> in research, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/grantmcdermott/skeptic-priors/blob/master/Makefile">this
one</a> from
a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03089-x">paper</a> by
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@gmcd">Grant McDermott</a>. You can use <code>make</code> as a to
orchestrate several programming languages or cli tools, but you will need to
write code to pass data from one script to the other. <code>{targets}</code> deals with
that transparently by serialising all the targets’ outputs using <code>saveRDS()</code>
but this only works because only R is supported. But if you’re trying to make
R, Python, and whatever else work together, you will need to deal with this
manually and find a common interface to pass data around.</p>
<p>Despite this, using <code>make</code>, or some other tool on top of the required programming
languages (and not tied to either one), is likely the best solution and it turns
out that Nix can be used just like that! But why use Nix and not <code>make</code> then?
Well, using Nix guarantees that whatever you produce will be completely
reproducible. With <code>make</code>, you would need to either run it inside a Docker image
or… inside a development environment built with Nix! I did something similar
in <a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2023-07-19-nix_for_r_part2/">this blog post</a>
where I ran a <code>{targets}</code> pipeline inside a Nix environment to make the analysis
reproducible.</p>
<p>But if I’m already defining a reproducible development environment using Nix,
why not go all the way and build a complete project using Nix? After all, Nix
allows you to package <em>software</em> and what is <em>software</em> but 0’s and 1’s? And
what is a trained model, a paper or report in the PDF format, predictions
exported into a CSV file, etc, if not 0’s and 1’s?</p>
<p>Just like with any other build automation tool, Nix will only rebuild the
project if something changes, and will only rebuild the parts that need to be
rebuilt. So if you change a file somewhere, only whatever depends on this file
will get rebuilt, just like with <code>{targets}</code>, or <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nixbat/tree/master">following repository</a>
you can find an example of this.</p>
<p>This is a very simple project: two functions are defined in the
<code>python_functions.py</code> script. These functions are nothing special, and could be
used interactively. One function reads a <code>.csv</code> file from the Internet and
returns it, the other does some basic cleaning. Here are these two functions
included in the <code>python_functions.py</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>from pandas import read_csv

def download_iris(iris_csv_url):
    # Read the CSV file
    df = read_csv(iris_csv_url)

    return df

def process_iris(iris_csv_path):
    # Read the CSV file
    df = read_csv(iris_csv_path)

    # Replace the species numbers with their corresponding names
    species_mapping = {0: &quot;setosa&quot;, 1: &quot;virginica&quot;, 2: &quot;versicolor&quot;}
    df[&#39;species&#39;] = df[&#39;species&#39;].replace(species_mapping)

    return df</code></pre>
<p>Then, I want to use <code>{ggplot2}</code> to plot this data. You will notice the lack of R
script in the repo. I did this on purpose, because I wanted to show how you
could directly write R code inside of a Nix expression. But in practice, it is
better to have Python code in a Python script, R code in an R script, and then
use Nix to orchestrate the whole thing. But I just wanted to show you that you
could, if you wanted to, have a completely self-contained Nix expression that
encapsulates the business logic as well.</p>
<p>There’s also a <code>.Qmd</code> file: this is the file that will get compiled into a PDF
document, and is the output of the whole project. It could be anything else! As
I stated above, this is just 0’s and 1’s so it could very well be some other
output, it doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p>Let’s now take a look at the <code>default.nix</code> that builds the whole thing. Let’s
start by the top-level definitions:</p>
<pre><code>let
  pkgs =
    import
      (fetchTarball &quot;https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/27285241da3bb285155d549a11192e9fdc3a0d04.tar.gz&quot;)
      { };

  tex = (
    pkgs.texlive.combine {
      inherit (pkgs.texlive) scheme-small;
    }
  );

  # Because building happens in sandbox that cannot connect to the internet
  # we need to download assets beforehand
  iris_path = pkgs.fetchurl {
    url = &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-rodrigues/nixbat/7c319bcdbe15e7f7182e7685b8de176a40d0bde9/iris.csv&quot;;
    hash = &quot;sha256-2H6THCXKxIt4yxnDDY+AZRmbxqs7FndCp4MqaAR1Cpw=&quot;;
  };

  # Common python dependencies to use in my intermediary inputs
  pythonEnv = pkgs.python312.withPackages (ps: with ps; [ pandas ]);

  # Common python sources
  python_src = pkgs.lib.fileset.toSource {
    root = ./.;
    fileset = ./python_functions.py;
  };</code></pre>
<p>Some variables are defined there:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pkgs</code>: this is the set of Nix packages to be used. All the dependencies of
the project will get built using the Nix expressions available in the
<code>nixpkgs</code> Github repository at a specific commit. This ensures that the output
of this expression will always be exactly the same.</li>
<li><code>tex</code>: defines the set of LaTeX packages I need to compile the PDF.</li>
<li><code>iris_path</code>: the Python function I use to load the data takes a path, or url,
to read the iris dataset. Because building a derivation happens in a sandbox,
I need to download assets beforehand. This is what the <code>fetchurl</code> function
does. I can then refer to the file path using <code>${iris_path}</code> later on.</li>
<li><code>pythonEnv</code>: This lists the dependencies I will need to run my Python
functions.</li>
<li><code>pythonSrc</code>: Defines the path to the <code>python_functions.py</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, I want to call each of my functions separately, and I want them to produce
a single output. So for this, I now build a derivation, one per output. I start
with the first one:</p>
<pre><code>downloadCsv = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = &quot;download-csv&quot;;
  buildInputs =  [ pythonEnv ];
  src = pythonSrc;
  buildPhase = &#39;&#39;
      python -c &quot;
import pandas as pd
from python_functions import download_iris

iris_raw = download_iris(&#39;${iris_path}&#39;)

iris_raw.to_csv(&#39;iris_raw.csv&#39;, index=False)
      &quot;
    &#39;&#39;;
  installPhase = &#39;&#39;
    mkdir -p $out
    cp iris_raw.csv $out/
  &#39;&#39;;
  };</code></pre>
<p>At first sight, there might seem that a lot is going on, but let’s take a closer
look:</p>
<ul>
<li>first I give it a name: <code>name = "download-csv"</code></li>
<li>second, I list its dependencies in <code>buildInputs</code>. This is what’s required to
build the target!</li>
<li>then, I provide the source, in this case the <code>python_functions.py</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, I need to run the code, and this is what happens in the <code>buildPhase</code>. This
is exactly the code you would write if you were using a script to glue your
functions together. See how I use <code>${iris_path}</code> to refer to the path to the
file defined above. Finally, in the <code>installPhase</code> I copy the <code>.csv</code> file to
<code>$out/</code>, which essentially copies the file into the Nix store, making it
available for the next derivations.</p>
<p>In the next derivation, I now use the second Python function to clean the data:</p>
<pre><code>cleanCsv = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
    name = &quot;clean-csv&quot;;
    buildInputs =  [ pythonEnv ];
    src = pythonSrc;
    buildPhase = &#39;&#39;
      python -c &quot;
import pandas as pd
from python_functions import process_iris

iris = process_iris(&#39;${downloadCsv}/iris_raw.csv&#39;)

iris.to_csv(&#39;iris.csv&#39;, index=False)
      &quot;
    &#39;&#39;;
    installPhase = &#39;&#39;
      mkdir -p $out
      cp iris.csv $out/
    &#39;&#39;;
  };</code></pre>
<p>This is not very different than what I did before. Just notice how I refer to
the output of the first derivation: <code>${downloadCsv}/iris_raw.csv</code>.</p>
<p>Now comes the last intermediary derivation, the one that uses R to create a
plot:</p>
<pre><code>generatePlot = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
    name = &quot;generate-plot&quot;;
    buildInputs = with pkgs; [
      R
      rPackages.ggplot2
      rPackages.janitor
    ];
    dontUnpack = true;
    buildPhase = &#39;&#39;
            Rscript -e &quot;

      library(ggplot2)
      library(janitor)

      iris &lt;- read.csv(&#39;${cleanCsv}/iris.csv&#39;) |&gt;
        clean_names() |&gt;
        transform(species = as.character(species))

      p &lt;- ggplot(iris,
                  aes(x = sepal_length, y = sepal_width, color = species)) +
          geom_point(size = 3) +
          labs(title = &#39;Sepal Length vs Sepal Width&#39;,
               x = &#39;Sepal Length&#39;,
               y = &#39;Sepal Width&#39;) +
          theme_minimal() +
          theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))


      ggsave(&#39;plot.png&#39;, plot = p, width = 6, height = 4, dpi = 300)

      &quot;
    &#39;&#39;;
    installPhase = &#39;&#39;
      mkdir -p $out
      cp plot.png $out/
    &#39;&#39;;
  };</code></pre>
<p>As I said above, to make this better, it would need to be a function defined in
its own R script, as this way there’s a nice separation of concerns. On one
hand, there’s the business logic in Python and R scripts, and on the other
there’s the orchestration in Nix. Putting R code in the Nix expression makes
this less flexible, but I wanted to show you that this is also a possibility!</p>
<p>Now comes the last part of the Nix expression, the actual thing I want to build,
a PDF that uses the generated plot as an input:</p>
<pre><code>in
# Derivation to generate the PDF report from Markdown
pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = &quot;generate-report&quot;;
  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.quarto
    tex
  ];
  src = pkgs.lib.fileset.toSource {
        root = ./.;
        # Only include report.Qmd in the source
        fileset = ./report.Qmd;
  };
  buildPhase = &#39;&#39;

    cp ${generatePlot}/plot.png .

    # Deno needs to add stuff to $HOME/.cache
    # so we give it a home to do this
    mkdir home
    export HOME=$PWD/home
    quarto render report.Qmd --to pdf

  &#39;&#39;;

  installPhase = &#39;&#39;
    mkdir -p $out
    cp report.pdf $out/
  &#39;&#39;;
}</code></pre>
<p>Notice the dependencies of this derivation: <code>quarto</code> and <code>tex</code> (<code>tex</code> is the
variable I defined right at the beginning that lists LaTeX packages). I then
need to specify <code>report.Qmd</code> as the source of this derivation, and copy the plot
generated before in R into the working/build directory. There’s also a
idiosyncrasy where a dependency of Quarto, Deno, needs to have a directory to
save some stuff in it. Nix being Nix, we need to manually define such a home
directory for reproducibility purposes. If it would be using my <code>home/</code>
directory on my machine, this wouldn’t be reproducible! We finish the
<code>buildPhase</code> by rendering the document, and then <em>install</em> it into <code>$out/</code>. To
build this project, you need to have Nix installed and then type <code>nix-build</code>,
or alternatively, <code>nix-build -Q</code> which hides all the output of the build phases
(so you don’t see any warnings or messages thrown by either Python or R).</p>
<p>This will build the PDF, which you can then find in the Nix store. You’ll notice
a file called <code>result</code> appear next to all your other files from the project. In
a terminal, call <code>readlink result</code> and this will show you the path to the
generated PDF, which you can now read!</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think that this is a really useful way to orchestrate code
written in different programming languages, but I would not use this for
monolingual projects. For R, I’ll keep using <code>{targets}</code> together with a Nix
shell to ensure reproducibility. Also, to really benefit from this, your code
needs, ideally, to be written as a series of functions, each outputting a single
object. Instead, if you write a script to orchestrate the whole thing in R or
Python, and then put a Nix expression on top of it, I’m not sure it’s really
worth it. Might as well just use a Nix shell then and execute your scripts in
it.</p>
<p>Also, let me state that this is my first attempt at using Nix for such a
purpose, and there might be a better/more elegant way of doing it, so if you
have any input, don’t hesitate!</p>
