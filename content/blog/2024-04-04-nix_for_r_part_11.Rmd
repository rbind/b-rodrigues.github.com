I have this package on CRAN called `{chronicler}` and last month I got an email
from CRAN telling me that building the package was failing, and I had two weeks
to fix it.

I immediately thought that some dependency that my package depends on got
updated, and somehow broke something. But when I checked the results of the
build, I was surprised, to say the least:



How come my package was only failing on Fedora? Now that was really weird. There
was no way this was right. Also, I couldn't reproduce this bug on my local
machine... but I could reproduce it on Github Actions, on Ubuntu (but it was ok
on CRAN's Ubuntu!), but couldn't reproduce it either on Windows! What was going
on? So I started digging, and my first idea was to look at the list of packages
that got released on CRAN on that day (March 11th 2024), and saw something that
caught my eye: a new version of `{tidyselect}` had just been released and even
though my package doesn't directly depend on it, I knew that this package was
likely a dependency of some direct dependency of `{chronicler}`. So I looked
into the release notes, and there it was:

```
* `eval_select()` out-of-bounds errors now use the verb "select" rather than
  "subset" in the error message for consistency with `dplyr::select()` (#271).
```

I knew this was what I was looking for, because the unit test that was failing
to pass was a test that should error because `dplyr::select()` was being used on
a column that didn't exist. So the success of that test was defined as *finding
the following error message in the log*, which contained the word *subset* but
now it should be *select*.

But why was this failing only on Fedora on CRAN and on Ubuntu on Github Actions
(but ok on Ubuntu on CRAN)? And why couldn't I reproduce the bug on my OpenSuse
Linux computer, even though I was building a bleeding edge development
environment using Nix?

And then it hit me like my older brother used to.

When building packages, CRAN doesn't seem to use pre-compiled binaries on
Fedora, so packages get built from source. This means that it takes longer to
test on Fedora, as packages have to be built from source, but it also means that
only the very latest releases of packages get used. On other platforms,
pre-compiled binaries get used if available, and because `{tidyselect}` had just
come out that very day, older binaries of `{tidyselect}` were being used on
these platforms, but not on Fedora. And because these older binaries didn't
include this change, the unit test was still passing successfully on there.

On Github Actions, code coverage was computed using `covr::codecov()` which
installs the package in a temporary directory and seems to pull its dependencies
directly from CRAN. Because CRAN doesn't offer Ubuntu binaries (use Dirk
Eddelbuettel's [r2u](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u) if you need that)
packages got compiled from source, hence why the test was failing there.

And on my local machine, even though I was using the latest commit of `nixpkgs`
to have the most bleeding edge packages for my environment, I had forgotten
that the R packages on `nixpkgs` always lag behind the CRAN releases.

This is because R packages on `nixpkgs` tend to get updated alongside a new release of R.
