<p>In this blog post, I am going to train a random forest on census data from the US to predict the probability that someone is looking for a job. To this end, I downloaded the US 1990 census data from the UCI <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/US+Census+Data+%281990%29">Machine Learning Repository</a>. Having a background in economics, I am always quite interested by such datasets. I downloaded the raw data which is around 820mb uncompressed. You can download it from this folder <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census1990-mld/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Before training a random forest on it, some preprocessing is needed. First problem: the columns in the data do not have names. Actually, training a random forest on unamed variables is possible, but I like my columns to have names. The names are on a separate file, called <code>USCensus1990raw.attributes.txt</code>. This is how this file looks like:</p>

<p>The variable names are always written in upper case and sometimes end with some numbers. Regular expressions will help extract these column names:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

census_raw = import(&quot;USCensus1990raw.data.txt&quot;)

attributes_raw = readLines(&quot;USCensus1990raw.attributes.txt&quot;)

column_names = str_extract_all(attributes_raw, &quot;^[A-Z]+(\\d{1,}|[A-Z])\\s+&quot;) %&gt;%
  flatten %&gt;%
  str_trim %&gt;%
  tolower</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>readLines</code> I load this text file into R. Then with <code>stringr::str_extract_all</code>, I can extract the variable names from this text file. The regular expression, <code>^[A-Z]+(\\d{1,}|[A-Z])\\s+</code> can seem complicated, but by breaking it up, it’ll be clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>^[A-Z]+</code>: matches one or more uppercase letter, at the beginning of the line (hence the <code>^</code>)</li>
<li><code>\\d{1,}</code>: matches one or more digits</li>
<li><code>[A-Z]\\s+</code>: matches one uppercase letter, followed by one or more spaces</li>
<li><code>(\\d{1,}|[A-Z])\\s+</code>: matches one or more digits OR (the <code>|</code>) matches one uppercase letter, followed by one or more spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>This regular expression matches only the variable names. By using <code>^</code> I only limit myself to the uppercase letters at the start of the line, which already removes a lot of unneeded lines from the text. Then, by matching numbers or letters, followed by spaces, I avoid matching strings such as <code>VAR:</code>. There’s probably a shorter way to write this regular expression, but since this one works, I stopped looking for another solution.</p>
<p>Now that I have a vector called <code>column_names</code>, I can baptize the columns in my dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>colnames(census_raw) &lt;- column_names</code></pre>
<p>I also add a column called <code>caseid</code> to the dataset, but it’s actually not really needed. But it made me look for and find <code>rownames_to_column()</code>, which can be useful:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>census = census_raw %&gt;%
  rownames_to_column(&quot;caseid&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now I select the variables I need. I use <code>dplyr::select()</code> to select the columns I need (actually, I will remove some of these later for the purposes of the blog post, but will continue exploring them. Maybe write a part 2?):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>census %&lt;&gt;%
  select(caseid, age, citizen, class, disabl1, disabl2, lang1, looking, fertil, hour89, hours, immigr,
         industry, means, occup, powpuma, powstate, pwgt1, race, ragechld, rearning,
         relat1, relat2, remplpar, rlabor, rpincome, rpob, rspouse, rvetserv, school, sex, tmpabsnt,
         travtime, week89, work89, worklwk, yearsch, yearwrk, yrsserv)</code></pre>
<p>Now, I convert factor variables to factors and only relevel the <code>race</code> variable:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>census %&lt;&gt;%
  mutate(race = case_when(race == 1 ~ &quot;white&quot;,
                          race == 2 ~ &quot;black&quot;,
                          !(race %in% c(1, 2)) ~ &quot;other&quot;,
                          is.na(race) ~ NA_character_)) %&gt;%
  filter(looking != 0) %&gt;%
  mutate_at(vars(class, disabl1, disabl2, lang1, looking, fertil, immigr, industry, means,
                 occup, powstate, race, ragechld, remplpar, rlabor, rpob, rspouse,
                 rvetserv, school, sex, tmpabsnt, work89, worklwk, yearwrk),
            as.factor) %&gt;%
  select(looking, age, class, disabl1, disabl2, lang1, fertil, immigr,
         race, ragechld, remplpar, rlabor, rpob, rspouse,
         rvetserv, school, sex, tmpabsnt, work89, worklwk, yearwrk, rpincome, rearning,
         travtime, week89, work89, hours, yearsch, yrsserv) %&gt;%
  as_tibble

export(census, &quot;regression_data.rds&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>So the variable I want to predict is <code>looking</code> which has 2 levels (I removed the level <code>0</code>, which stands for <code>NA</code>). I convert all the variables that are supposed to be factors into factors using <code>mutate_at()</code> and then reselect a subsample of the columns. <code>census</code> is now a tibble with 39 columns and 2458285 rows. I will train the forest on a subsample only, because with cross validation it would take forever on the whole dataset.</p>
<p>I run the training on another script, that I will then run using the <code>Rscript</code> command instead of running it from Spacemacs (yes, I don’t use RStudio at home but Spacemacs + ESS). Here’s the script:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(caret)
library(doParallel)
library(rio)

reg_data = import(&quot;regression_data.rds&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>janitor::tabyl(reg_data$looking)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>reg_data$looking      n   percent
1                1  75792 0.1089562
2                2 619827 0.8910438</code></pre>
<p>90% of the individuals in the sample are not looking for a new job. For training purposes, I will only use 50000 observations instead of the whole sample. I’m already thinking about writing another blog post where I show how to use the whole data. But 50000 observations should be more than enough to have a pretty nice model. However, having 90% of observations belonging to a single class can cause problems with the model; the model might predict that everyone should belong to class 2 and in doing so, the model would be 90% accurate! Let’s ignore this for now, but later I am going to tackle this issue with a procedure calleds SMOTE.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)
sample_df = sample_n(reg_data, 50000)</code></pre>
<p>Now, using <code>caret::trainIndex()</code>, I partition the data into a training sample and a testing sample:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>trainIndex = createDataPartition(sample_df$looking, p = 0.8,
                                 list = FALSE,
                                 times = 1)

train_data = sample_df[trainIndex, ]
test_data = sample_df[-trainIndex, ]</code></pre>
<p>I also save the testing data to disk, because when the training is done I’ll lose my R session (remember, I’ll run the training using Rscript):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>saveRDS(test_data, &quot;test_data.rds&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Before training the model, I’ll change some options; I’ll do 5-fold cross validation that I repeat 5 times. This will further split the training set into training/testing sets which will increase my confidence in the metrics that I get from the training. This will ensure that the best model really is the best, and not a fluke resulting from the splitting of the data that I did beforehand. Then, I will test the best model on the testing data from above:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fitControl &lt;- trainControl(
  method = &quot;repeatedcv&quot;,
  number = 5,
  repeats = 5)</code></pre>
<p>A very nice feature from the <code>caret</code> package is the possibility to make the training in parallel. For this, load the <code>doParallel</code> package (which I did above), and then register the number of cores you want to use for training with <code>makeCluster()</code>. You can replace <code>detectCores()</code> by the number of cores you want to use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cl = makeCluster(detectCores())
registerDoParallel(cl)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we can train the model:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fit_caret = train(looking ~ .,
                  data = train_data,
                  trainControl = fitControl)</code></pre>
<p>Because it takes around 1 and a half hours to train, I save the model to disk using <code>saveRDS()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>saveRDS(fit_caret, &quot;model_unbalanced.rds&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The picture below shows all the cores from my computer running and RAM usage being around 20gb during the training process:</p>
<p><img src="/img/training_cpu.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>And this the results of training the random forest on the unbalanced data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>model_unbalanced = readRDS(&quot;model_unbalanced.rds&quot;)

test_data = readRDS(&quot;test_data.rds&quot;)

plot(model_unbalanced)

preds = predict.train(model_unbalanced, newdata = test_data)

<p>If someone really is looking for a job, the model is able to predict it correctly 92% of the times and 98% of the times if that person is not looking for a job. It’s slightly better than simply saying than no one is looking for a job, which would be right 90% of the times, but not great either.</p>
<p>To train to make the model more accurate in predicting class 1, I will resample the training set, but by downsampling class 2 and upsampling class 1. This can be done with the function <code>SMOTE()</code> from the <code>{DMwR}</code> package. However, the testing set should have the same distribution as the population, so I should not apply <code>SMOTE()</code> to the testing set. I will resplit the data, but this time with a 95/5 % percent split; this way I have 5% of the original dataset used for testing, I can use <code>SMOTE()</code> on the 95% remaining training set. Because <code>SMOTE</code>ing takes some time, I save the <em>SMOTE</em>d training set using <code>readRDS()</code> for later use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reg_data = import(&quot;regression_data.rds&quot;)

                                 times = 1)

<p>The balanced accuracy is higher, but unlike what I expected (and hoped), this model is worse in predicting class 1! I will be trying one last thing; since I have a lot of data at my disposal, I will simply sample 25000 observations where the target variable <code>looking</code> equals 1, and then sample another 25000 observations where the target variable equals 2 (without using <code>SMOTE()</code>). Then I’ll simply bind the rows and train the model on that:</p>

<p>Looks like it’s not much better than using <code>SMOTE()</code>!</p>
<p>There are several ways I could achieve better predictions; tuning the model is one possibility, or perhaps going with another type of model altogether. I will certainly come back to this dataset in future blog posts!</p>
<p>Using the best model, let’s take a look at which variables are the most important for predicting job search:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; varImp(model_unbalanced)

only 20 most important variables shown (out of 109)

rlabor3   100.0000

<p>It’s also possible to have a plot of the above:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(varImp(model_unbalanced))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/img/varimp.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>To make sense of this, we have to read the description of the features <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census1990-mld/USCensus1990raw.attributes.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p><code>rlabor3</code> is the most important variable, and means that the individual is unemployed. <code>rlabor6</code> means not in the labour force. Then the age of the individual as well as the individual’s income play a role. <code>tmpabsnt</code> is a variable that equals 1 if the individual is temporary absent from work, due to a layoff. All these variables having an influence on the probability of looking for a job make sense, but looks like a very simple model focusing on just a couple of variables would make as good a job as the random forest.</p>
