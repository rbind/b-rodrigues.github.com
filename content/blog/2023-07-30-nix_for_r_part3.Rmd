This is the third post in a series of posts about Nix. Disclaimer: I'm a super
beginner with Nix. So this series of blog posts is more akin to notes that I'm
taking while learning than a super detailed tutorial. So if you're a Nix expert
and read something stupid in here, that's normal. This post is going to focus on
R (obviously) but the ideas are applicable to any programming language.

This blog post is part tutorial on creating an api using the `{plumber}` R
package, part an illustration of how Nix makes developing and deploying a
breeze.

## Part 1: getting it to work locally

So in [part 1](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2023-07-13-nix_for_r_part1/) I
explained what Nix was and how you could use it to build reproducible
development environments. In [part
2](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2023-07-19-nix_for_r_part2/) I talked about
running a `{targets}` pipeline in a reproducible environment set up with Nix,
and in this blog post I'll talk about how I made an api using {plumber} and how
Nix made going from my development environment to the production environment (on
Digital Ocean) the simplest ever. Originally I wanted to focus on interactive
work using Nix, but that'll be very likely for part 4, maybe even part 5 (yes, I
really have a lot to write about).

Let me just first explain what `{plumber}` is before continuing. I already
talked about `{plumber}`
[here](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2021-06-04-own_knit_server/), but in
summary, `{plumber}` allows you to build an api. What is an api? Essentially a
service that you can call in different ways and which returns something to you.
For example, you could send a Word document to this api and get back the same
document converted in PDF. Or you could send some English text and get back a
translation. Or you could send some data and get a prediction from a machine
learning model. It doesn't matter: what's important is that apis completely
abstract the programming language that is being used to compute whatever should
be computed. With `{plumber}`, you can create such services using R. This is
pretty awesome, because it means that whatever it is you can make with R, you
could build a service around it and make it available to anyone. Of course you
need a server that actually has R installed and that gets and processes the
requests it receives, and this is where the problems start. And by problems I
mean THE single biggest problem that you have to deal with whenever you develop
something on your computer, and then have to make it work somewhere else:
deployment. If you've had to deal with deployments you might not understand why
it's so hard. I certainly didn't really get it until I've wanted to deploy my
first Shiny app, many moons ago. And this is especially true whenever you don't
want to use any "off the shelf" services like *shinyapps.io*. In the [blog post
I mentioned above](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2021-06-04-own_knit_server/),
I used Docker to deploy the api. But Docker, while an amazing tool, is also
quite heavy to deal with. Nix offers an alternative to Docker which I think you
should know and think about. Let me try to convince you.

So let's make a little `{plumber}` api and deploy that in the cloud. For this, I'm
using Digital Ocean, but any other service that allows you to spin a virtual
machine (VM) with Ubuntu on it will do. If you don't have a Digital Ocean
account, you can use my [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/b68adc727710) to get
200$ in credit for 60 days, more than enough to experiment. A VM serving a
`{plumber}` api needs at least 1 gig of RAM, and the cheapest one with 1 gig of
ram is 6$ a month (if you spend 25$ of that credit, I'll get 25$ too, so don't
hesitate to experiment, you'll be doing me a solid as well).

I won't explain what my api does, this doesn't really matter for this blog post.
But I'll have to explain it in a future blog post, because it's related to a
package I'm working on, called [{rix}](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rix) which
I'm writing to ease the process of building reproducible environments for R
using Nix. So for this blog post, let's make something very simple: let's take
the classic machine learning task of predicting survival of the passengers of
the Titanic (which was not that long ago in the news again...) and make a
service out of it.

What's going to happen is this: users will make a request to the api giving some
basic info about themselves: a simple ML model (I'll go with logistic regression
and call it "machine learning" just to make the statisticians reading this
seethe lmao), the machine learning model is going to use this to compute a
prediction and the result will be returned to the user. Now to answer a question
that comes up often when I explain this stuff: *why not use Shiny? Users can
enter their data and get a prediction and there's a nice UI and everything?!*.
Well yes, but it depends on what it is you actually want to do. An api is useful
mostly in situations where you need that request to be made by another machine
and then that machine will do something else with that prediction it got back.
It could be as simple as showing it in a nice interface, or maybe the machine
that made the request will then use that prediction and insert it somewhere for
archiving for example. So think of it this way: use an api when machines need to
interact with other machines, a Shiny app for when humans need to interact with
a machine.

Ok so first, because I'm using Nix, I'll create an environment that will contain
everything I need to build this api. I'm doing that in the most simple way
possible, simply by specifying an R version and the packages I need inside a
file called `default.nix`. Writing this file if you're not familiar with Nix can
be daunting, so I've developed a package, called `{rix}` to write these files
for you. Calling this:

```{r, eval = F}
rix::rix(r_ver = "4.2.2",
         r_pkgs = c("plumber", "tidymodels"),
         other_pkgs = NULL,
         git_pkgs = NULL,
         ide = "other",
         path = "titanic_api/", # you might need to create this folder
         overwrite = TRUE)
```

generates this file for me:

```
# This file was generated by the {rix} R package on Sat Jul 29 15:50:41 2023
# It uses nixpkgs' revision 8ad5e8132c5dcf977e308e7bf5517cc6cc0bf7d8 for reproducibility purposes
# which will install R version 4.2.2
# Report any issues to https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rix
{ pkgs ? import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/8ad5e8132c5dcf977e308e7bf5517cc6cc0bf7d8.tar.gz") {} }:

  with pkgs;

  let
  my-r = rWrapper.override {
    packages = with rPackages; [
      plumber tidymodels
    ];
  };
  in
  mkShell {
    buildInputs = [
      my-r
      ];
  }
```

(for posterity's sake: this is using [this version of
{rix}](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rix/tree/935fb194b38adfb085a5bda9ebe5dc5bb504f2cb).
Also, if you want to learn more about `{rix}` take a look at its
[website](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rix/). It's still in very early
development, comments and PR more than welcome!)

To build my api I'll have to have `{plumber}` installed. I also install the
`{tidymodels}` package. I actually don't need `{tidymodels}` for what I'm doing
(base R can fit logistic regressions just fine), but the reason I'm installing
it is to mimic a "real-word example" as closely as possible (a project with some
dependencies).

When I called `rix::rix()` to generate the `default.nix` file, I specified that
I wanted R version 4.2.2 (because let's say that this is the version I need.
It's also possible to get the current version of R by passing "current" to
`r_ver`). You don't see any reference to this version of R in the `default.nix`
file, but this is the version that will get installed because it's the version
that comes with that particular revision of the `nixpkgs` repository:

```
"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/8ad5e8132c5dcf977e308e7bf5517cc6cc0bf7d8.tar.gz"
```

This url downloads that particular revision on `nixpkgs` containing R version
4.2.2. `{rix}` finds the right revision for you (using [this handy
service](https://lazamar.co.uk/nix-versions/?channel=nixpkgs-unstable&package=r)).

While `{rix}` doesn't require your system to have Nix installed, if you want to
continue you'll have to install Nix. To install Nix, I recommend you don't use
the official installer, even if it's quite simple to use. Instead, the
[Determinate Systems](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install) installer seems
better to me. On Windows, you will need to enable WSL2. An alternative is to run
all of this inside a Docker container (but more on this later if you're thinking
something along the lines of *isn't the purpose of Nix to not have to use
Docker?* then see you in the conclusion). Once you have Nix up and running, go
inside the `titanic_api/` folder (which contains the `default.nix` file above)
and run the following command inside a terminal:

```
nix-build
```

This will build the environment according to the instructions in the
`default.nix` file. Depending on what you want/need, this can take some time.
Once the environment is done building, you can "enter" into it by typing:

```
nix-shell
```

Now this is where you would use this environment to work on your api. As I
stated above, I'll discuss interactive work using a Nix environment in a future
blog post. Leave the terminal with this Nix shell open and create an empty text
wile next to `default.nix` and call it `titanic_api.R` and put this in there
using any text editor of your choice:

```{r, eval = F}
#* Would you have survived the Titanic sinking?
#* @param sex Character. "male" or "female"
#* @param age Integer. Your age.
#* @get /prediction
function(sex, age) {

  trained_logreg <- readRDS("trained_logreg.rds")

  dataset <- data.frame(sex = sex, age = as.numeric(age))

  parsnip::predict.model_fit(trained_logreg,
                             new_data = dataset)

}
```

This script is a `{plumber}` api. It's a simple function that uses an already
*trained* logistic regression (lol) by loading it into its scope using the
`readRDS()` function. It then returns a prediction. The script that I wrote to
train the model is this one:

```{r, eval = F}
library(parsnip)

titanic_raw <- read.csv("https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/stuff/titanic.csv")

titanic <- titanic_raw |>
  subset(select = c(Survived,
                    Sex,
                    Age))

names(titanic) <- c("survived", "sex", "age")

titanic$survived = as.factor(titanic$survived)

logreg_spec <- logistic_reg() |>
  set_engine("glm")

trained_logreg <- logreg_spec |>
  fit(survived ~ ., data = titanic)

saveRDS(trained_logreg, "trained_logreg.rds")
```

If you're familiar with this Titanic prediction task, you will have noticed that
the script above is completely stupid. I only kept two variables to fit the
logistic regression. But the reason I did this is because this blog post is not
about fitting models, but about apis. So bear with me. Anyways, once you're run
the script above to generate the file `trained_logreg.rds` containing the
trained model, you can locally test the api using `{plumber}`. Go back to the
terminal that is running your Nix shell, and now type `R` to start R in that
session. You can then run your api inside that session using:

```{r, eval = F}
plumber::pr("titanic_api.R") |>
  plumber::pr_run(port = "8000")
```

Open your web browser and visit
[http://localhost:8000/__docs__/](http://localhost:8000/__docs__/)
to see the Swagger interface to your api (Swagger is a nice little tool
that makes testing your apis way easier).

<div style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="/img/swagger_plumber.png" width="60%">
</div>

Using Swagger you can try out your api, click on (1) then on (2). You can enter
some mock data in (3) and (4) and then run the computation by clicking on
"Execute" (5). You'll see the result in (7). (6) gives you a `curl` command to
run exactly this example from a terminal. Congrats, your `{plumber}` api is
running on your computer! Now we need to deploy it online and make it available to
the world.

## Deploying your api

So if you have a Digital Ocean account log in (and if you don't, use my
[referral link](https://m.do.co/c/b68adc727710) to get 200$ to test things out)
and click on the top-right corner on the "Create" button, and then select "Droplet"
(a fancy name for a VM):

<div style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="/img/digital_ocean_1.png" width="60%">
</div>

In the next screen, select the region closest to you and then select Ubuntu as
the operating system, "Regular" for the CPU options, and then the 4$ (or the 6$,
it doesn't matter at this stage) a month Droplet. We will need to upgrade it
immediately after having created it in order to actually build the environment.
This is because building the environment requires some more RAM than what the
6$ option offers, but starting from the cheapest option ensures that we
will then be able to downsize back to it, after the build process is done.

<div style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="/img/digital_ocean_2.png" width="60%">
</div>

Next comes how you want to authenticate to your VM. There are two options, one
using an SSH key, another using a password. If you're already using Git, you can
use the same SSH key. Click on "New SSH Key" and paste the public key in the box
(you should find the key under `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` if you're using Linux). If
you're not using Git and have no idea what SSH keys are, my first piece of
advice is to start using Git and then to generate an SSH key and login using it.
This is much more secure than a password. Finally, click on "Create Droplet".
This will start building your VM. Once the Droplet is done building, you can
check out its IP address:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/img/digital_ocean_3.png" width="100%">
</div>

Let's immediately resize the Droplet to a larger size. As I said before,
this is only required to build our production environment using Nix. Once
the build is done, we can downsize again to the cheapest Droplet:

<div style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="/img/digital_ocean_4.png" width="100%">
</div>

Choose a Droplet with 2 gigs of RAM to be on the safe side, and also enable the
reserved IP option (this is a static IP that will never change):

<div style="text-align:center;">
 <img src="/img/digital_ocean_5.png" width="80%">
</div>

Finally, turn on your Droplet, it's time to log in to it using SSH.

Open a terminal on your computer and connect to your Droplet using SSH (starting
now, `user@local_computer` refers to a terminal opened on your computer and
`root@droplet` to an active ssh session inside your Droplet):

```
user@local_computer > ssh root@IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_DROPLET
```

and add a folder that will contain the project's files:

```
root@droplet > mkdir titanic_api
```

Great, let's now copy our files to the Droplet using `scp`. Open a terminal on
your computer, and navigate to where the `default.nix` file is. If you prefer
doing this graphically, you can use Filezilla. Run the following command to
copy the `default.nix` file to the Droplet:

```
user@local_computer > scp default.nix root@IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_DROPLET:/root/titanic_api/
```

Now go back to the terminal that is logged into your Droplet. We now need to
install Nix. For this, follow the instructions from the [Determinate
Systems](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install) installer, and run this line in
the Droplet:

```
root@droplet > curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

Pay attention to the final message once the installation is done:

```
Nix was installed successfully!
To get started using Nix, open a new shell or run `. /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh`
```

So run `. /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh` to start
the Nix daemon. Ok so now comes the magic of Nix. You can now build the exact
same environment that you used to build the pipeline on your computer in this
Droplet. Simply run `nix-build` for the build process to start. I don't really
know how to describe how easy and awesome this is. You may be thinking *well
installing R and a couple of packages is not that hard*, but let me remind you
that we are using a Droplet that is running Ubuntu, which is likely NOT the
operating system that you are running. Maybe you are on Windows, maybe you are
on macOS, or maybe you're running another Linux distribution. Whatever it is
you're using, it will be different from that Droplet. Even if you're running
Ubuntu on your computer, chances are that you've changed the CRAN repositories
from the default Ubuntu ones to the Posit ones, or maybe you're using
[r2u](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u). Basically, the chances that you will
have the exact same environment in that Droplet than the one running on your
computer is basically 0. And if you're already familiar with Docker, I think
that you will admit that this is much, much easier than dockerizing your
`{plumber}` api. If you don't agree, please shoot me an
[email](mailto:bruno@brodrigues.co) and tell me why, I'm honestly curious. Also,
let me stress again that if you needed to install a package like `{xlsx}` that
requires Java to be installed, Nix would install the right version of Java for
you.

Once the environment is done building, you can downsize your Droplet. Go back to
your Digital Ocean account, select that Droplet and choose "Resize Droplet", and
go back to the 6$ a month plan.

SSH back into the Droplet and copy the trained model `trained_logreg.rds` and
the api file, `titanic_api.R` to the Droplet using `scp` or Filezilla. It's time
to run the api. To do so, the obvious way would be simply to start an R session
and to execute the code to run the api. However, if something happens and the R
session dies, the api won't restart. Instead, I'm using a CRON job and an
utility called `run-one`. This utility, pre-installed in Ubuntu, runs one (1)
script at a time, and ensures that only one instance of said script is running.
So by putting this in a CRON job (CRON is a scheduler, so it executes a script
as often as you specify), `run-one` will try to run the script. If it's still
running, nothing happens, if the script is not running, it runs it.

So go back to your local computer, and create a new text file, call it
`run_api.sh` and write the following text in it:

```
#!/bin/bash
while true
do
nix-shell /root/titanic_api/default.nix --run "Rscript -e 'plumber::pr_run(plumber::pr(\"/root/titanic_api/titanic_api.R\"), host = \"0.0.0.0\", port=80)'"
 sleep 10
done
```

then copy this to your VM using `scp` or Filezilla, to
`/root/titanic_api/run_api.sh`. Then SSH back into your Droplet, go to where
the script is using `cd`:

```
root@droplet > cd /root/titanic_api/
```

and make the script executable:

```
root@droplet > chmod +x run_api.sh
```

We're almost done. Now, let's edit the `crontab`, to specify that we want
this script to be executed every hour using `run-one` (so if it's running,
nothing happens, if it died, it gets restarted). To edit the `crontab`,
type `crontab -e` and select the editor you're most comfortable with. If
you have no idea, select the first option, `nano`. Using your keyboard
keys, navigate all the way down and type:

```
*/60 * * * * run-one /root/titanic_api/run_api.sh
```

save the file by typing `CTRL-X`, and then type `Y` when asked `Save modified
buffer?`, and then type the `ENTER` key when prompted for `File name to write`.

We are now ready to start the api. Make sure CRON restarts by running:

```
root@droplet > service cron reload
```

and then run the script using `run-one`:

```
root@droplet > run-one /root/titanic_api/run_api.sh &
```

`run-one` will now run the script and will ensure that only one instance of the
script is running (the `&` character at the end means "run this in the
background"). If for any reason the process dies, CRON will restart an instance
of the script. We can now call our api using this `curl` command:

```
user@local_computer > curl -X GET "http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_DROPLET/prediction?sex=female&age=45" -H "accept: */*"
```

If you don't have `curl` installed, you can use [this
webservice](https://reqbin.com/curl). You should see this answer:

```
[{
    ".pred_class": "1"
}]
```

I'll leave my Droplet running for a few days after I post this, so if you
want you can try it out run this:

```
curl -X GET "http://142.93.164.182/prediction?sex=female&age=45" -H "accept: */*"
```

The answer is in the JSON format, and can now be ingested by some other script
which can now process it further.

# Conclusion

This was a long blog post. While it is part of my Nix series of blog posts, I
almost didn't talk about it, and this is actually the neat part. Nix made
something that is usually difficult to solve trivially simple. Without Nix, the
alternative would be to bundle the api with all its dependencies and an R
interpreter using Docker or install everything by hand on the server. But the
issue with Docker is that it's not necessarily much easier than Nix, and you
still have to make sure building the image is reproducible. So you have to make
sure to use an image that ships with the right version of R and use `{renv}` to
restore your packages. If you have system-level dependencies that are required,
you also have to deal with those. Nix takes care of all of this for you, so that
you can focus on all the other aspects of deployment, which take the bulk of the
effort and time.

In the post I mentioned that you could also run Nix inside a Docker container.
If you are already invested in Docker, Nix is still useful because you can use
base NixOS images (NixOS is a Linux distribution that uses Nix as its package
manager) or you could install Nix inside an Ubuntu image and then benefit from
the reproducibility offered by Nix. Simply add `RUN nix-build` to your
Dockerfile, and everything you need gets installed. You can even use Nix to
build Docker images instead of writing a Dockerfile. The possibilities are
endless!

Now, before you start building apis using R, you may want to read this blog post
[here](https://matthewrkaye.com/posts/2023-06-29-lessons-learned-from-running-r-in-production/lessons-learned-from-running-r-in-production.html)
as well. I found it quite interesting: it discusses the shortcomings of using
R to build apis like I showed you here, which I think you need to know. If you
have needs like the author of this blog post, then maybe R and `{plumber}` is not
the right solution for you.

Next time, in part 4, I'll either finally discuss how to do interactive work
using a Nix environment, or I'll discuss my package, `{rix}` in more detail.
We'll see!
