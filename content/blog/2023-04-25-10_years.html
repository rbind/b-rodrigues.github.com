<p>I’ve been blogging for 10 years, actually even a bit more than that, my very first
blog is not online anymore and if I remember correctly was in French. I think it
was around 2010 when I was a Master’s student.</p>
<p>Anyways, here are my thoughts on why I think blogging is a very nice activity if
you’re interested in technology or science.</p>
<p>The primary reason I started my blog was to have a repository of code snippets
that I could re-use. Anytime I had to do something for my thesis or for work, I
would write instructions around the code that I’ve used to explain how and why
things worked out. But I needed a spot to save these scripts, and it turns out
that a blog was the best solution for this: it doesn’t require any subscription
to a (very often proprietary) service to store my notes for me, and I need 0
discipline to maintain a blog. Simply write a post, push to Github, website gets
updated. If I would store the notes myself on my computer instead, this would
mean a lot of work, and I would need to think about how to make them available
across devices.</p>
<p>The other reason is that I thought that this would be a good way for me to
contribute to the wider free software and open source ecosystem. I’m not a
programmer, so contributing code would be quite difficult for me. I’ve recently
published a <a href="https://b-rodrigues.github.io/chronicler/">package</a>, so in the end
I ended up contributing code, but that was more due to “luck” finding an actual
problem that hadn’t been solved (well, that’s not really the case, logging in R
had been solved, but not using a monad and for some reason I had become obsessed
with monads in 2022) and also thanks to the help of much better programmers than
myself. So writing and posting these blog posts would be my way to contribute to
the community. I think that this was the right decision, as I’ve had many people
throughout the years thank me for some of my blog posts that helped them with
some of their tasks.</p>
<p>Now, not all blog posts were about problems that I encountered throughout my
career. There were also some blog posts about topics that piqued my interest,
but purely out of curiosity. For example the ones about NLP, like this
<a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2019-04-07-historical_newspaper_scraping_tesseract/">one</a>,
among others. I’m lucky enough that I find enjoyment in programming and exploring
data for fun, so I do write a lot of code. But how did I manage to consistently
write blog posts for 10 years+?</p>
<p>I think that part of the reason is that I have literally 0 commitment to this
blog. I don’t force myself to write on a schedule and sometimes don’t write for
months like in 2020 where I didn’t write for 5 months because I was busy
renovating my home and taking care of my baby daughter. I didn’t even miss
writing. I think that one of the reasons this works is also because I have
absolutely 0 trackers on this website. For all I know, this post will get read
by 3 people, me, you and my mom. The only clue I have that one particular post
was successful is if people reshare the announcement I make on social media, or
if they contact me with questions or praise, or if it gets picked up for the R
weekly highlights. By not having any trackers and not having really a clue of
what people like, I avoid falling into the “recommendation engine” or “SEO”
trap. If I did use trackers and knew exactly what my <em>audience</em> wanted, I’d be
very incentivized to just continue writing what would generate the most traffic.
And the issue with that, is that it would feel like a job, and I very likely
would have abandoned this endeavour a long time ago. What generates a lot of
traffic are posts mostly aimed at beginners, tutorials that explain how to do a
t-test or make a bar graph with two y-axes, but sorry, I’m not interested. I
don’t <em>hate</em> beginners, but I don’t only want to write tutorials to serve ads to
my readers and tell them to subscribe to newsletters, bla bla bla. I have no
qualms with people doing this, but that’s simply not my thing. Not interested (and
don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against tutorial blog post, quite the contrary,
especially when they present some lesser-known features of a package).</p>
<p>Also, the first thing I install on my web-browser is an ad-blocker, and I would
be a huge hypocrite if I tracked my blog’s visits. To be fully transparent, I do
use Goatcounter for my latest book <a href="https://raps-with-r.dev/">here</a>, but I don’t
adjust the book’s content to the audience. It’s just to know if people read it,
because writing a book takes some effort and I was curious. I might remove it in
the future though. Again, nothing against people trying to live off the
internet, I myself accept
<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/brodriguesco">donations</a>, but if I started to look
into what drives people to click and donate, I’d turn this into a job, and that
would be the fastest way for me to hate blogging.</p>
<p>So the reason this has been working is simply because I avoided considering this
as an obligation, a duty or a job, and in order to do this, I avoid collecting
data.</p>
<p>So blogging is a nice way to store code snippets and quickly find them. These
code snippets can in turn help other people facing similar issues. But what are
some other benefits of blogging? First, by turning your code into a full-fledged
blog post, it also forces you to think more carefully about the solution you
found. Very often, while writing the blog post to a problem I’ve solved, I often
find a simpler, more elegant solution, and then use that solution instead to
solve my problem. It’s a similar idea to rubber duck debugging, or writing a
Minimal Reproducible Example when opening an issue because (you think) you found
a nasty bug somewhere in that package you use daily and never bothered reading
the documentation for carefully. Blogging is also a way to get some feedback by
other people, and sometimes people show me other ways of doing things, like
<a href="https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2021-09-05-speedrunning_rows/">here</a>. Blogging
also helped me meet people in the real world, and discuss with them about
certain of the topics I’ve blogged about. I think that’s really neat.</p>
Blogging also helps (at least it helped me) realize what I really enjoy about
statistics, programming, and data science, and once you have a nice collection
of blog posts, you could turn them easily into a book. That’s another way of
contributing to the community. I’ve written two books, the latest one seems
to really interest people:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
My book is done. I need to write a conclusion to the last chapter and will likely rewrite some paragraphs, but I won't make major changes anymore.

<p>That’s my most “viral” tweet! Before it was this classic:</p>

<p>I’m sure that many people, maybe even you!, work in an industry that tackles
many interesting problems, and could share that with the world either through
blog posts or books, or videos (yes, I also do that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZXht1RTL2Duc3eU8MYGzQ">sometimes</a>), and many
people would find that interesting. I’ve had people tell me that they have
nothing interesting to write about, so they don’t even want to start. Who cares,
just write.</p>
<p>So it’d be cool if you blogged. I like it, so maybe you will as well?</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for reading, especially if you’ve been reading my blog for years.</p>
<p>Here’s to 10 more years!</p>
