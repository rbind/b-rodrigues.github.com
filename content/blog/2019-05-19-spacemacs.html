<p>The creation of this blog post was prompted by this tweet, asking an age-old question:</p>
{{% tweet "1128981852558123008" %}}
<p>This is actually a very important question, that I have been asking myself for a long time. An IDE,
and plain text editors, are a very important tools to anyone writing code. Most working hours are spent
within such a program, which means that one has to be careful about choosing the right one, and
once a choice is made, one has, in my humble opinion, learn as many features of this program as
possible to become as efficient as possible.</p>
<p>As you can notice from the tweet above, I suggested the use of <a href="http://spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a>…
and my tweet did not get any likes or retweets (as of the 19th of May, sympathetic readers of this
blog have liked the tweet). It is to set this great injustice straight that I
decided to write this blog post.</p>
<p>Spacemacs is a strange beast; if vi and Emacs had a baby, it would certainly look like Spacemacs.
So first of all, to understand what is Spacemacs, one has to know a bit about vi and Emacs.</p>
<p><img src="/img/vim.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>vi is a text editor with 43 years of history now. You might have heard of Vim (Vi IMproved) which is a
modern clone of vi, from 1991. More recently, another clone has been getting popular, Neovim, started
in 2014. Whatever version of vi however, its basic way of functioning remains the same. vi is a modal
editor, meaning that the user has to switch between different modes to work on a text file.
When vi is first started, the program will be in <em>Normal</em> mode. In this mode, trying to type a word
will likely result in nothing, or unexpected behaviour; unexpected, if you’re not familiar with vi.
For instance, in <em>Normal</em> mode, typing <strong>j</strong> will not show the character <strong>j</strong> on your screen.
Instead, this will move the cursor down one line. Typing <strong>p</strong> will paste, <strong>u</strong> will undo the
last action, <strong>y</strong> will yank (copy) etc…</p>
<p>To type text, first, one has to enter <em>Insert</em> mode, by typing <strong>i</strong> while in <em>Normal</em> mode. Only
then is it possible to write text. To go back to <em>Normal</em> mode, type <strong>ESC</strong>. Other modes are
<em>Visual</em> mode (from <em>Normal</em> mode press <strong>v</strong>), which allows the user to select text and <em>Command-line</em>
mode which can be entered by keying <strong>:</strong> from <em>Normal</em> mode and allows to enter commands.</p>
<p>Now you might be wondering why anyone would use such a convoluted way to type text. Well, this is
because one can chain these commands quite easily to perform repetitive tasks very quickly.
For instance, to delete a word, one types <strong>daw</strong> (in <em>Normal</em> mode), <strong>d</strong>elete <strong>a</strong> <strong>w</strong>ord.
To delete the next 3 words, you can type <strong>3daw</strong>. To edit the text between, for instance, <strong>()</strong>
you would type <strong>ci(</strong> (while in <em>Normal</em> mode and anywhere between the braces
containing the text to edit), <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>i</strong>n <strong>(</strong>. Same logic applies for <strong>ci[</strong> for instance. Can you guess
what <strong>ciw</strong> does? If you are in <em>Normal</em> mode, and you want to change the word the cursor is on, this
command will erase the word and put you in <em>Insert</em> mode so that you can write the new word.</p>
<p>These are just basic reasons why vi (or its clones) are awesome. It is also possible to automate
very long and complex tasks using macros. One starts a macro by typing <strong>q</strong> and then any letter of
the alphabet to name it, for instance <strong>a</strong>. The user then performs the actions needed, types <strong>q</strong>
again to stop the recording of the macro, and can then execute the macro with <strong><span class="citation">@a</span></strong>. If the user
needs to execute the macro say, 10 times, <strong>10@‌‌a</strong> does the trick. It is possible to extend vi’s
functionalities by using plugins, but more on that down below.</p>
<p>vi keybindings have inspired a lot of other programs. For instance, you can get extensions
for popular web browsers that mimick vi keybindings, such as
<a href="https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl">Tridayctl</a> for Firefox, or <a href="http://vimium.github.io/">Vivium</a>
for Chromium (or Google Chrome). There are even browsers that are built from scratch with support
for vi keybinds, such as my personal favorite, <a href="http://qutebrowser.org/">qutebrowser</a>. You can even
go further and use a tiling window manager on GNU-Linux, for instance <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, which
I use, or <a href="https://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a>. You might need to configure those to behave more like vi,
but it is possible. This means that by learning one set of keyboard shortcuts,
(and the logic behind chaining the keystrokes to achieve what you want), you can master several
different programs. This blog post only deals with the editor part, but as you can see, if you
go down the rabbit hole enough, a new exciting world opens up.</p>
<p>I will show some common vi operations below, but before that let’s discuss Emacs.</p>
<p><img src="/img/emacs.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>I am not really familiar with Emacs; I know that Emacs users only swear by it (just like vi users
only swear by vi), and that Emacs is not a modal editor. However, it contains a lot of functions
that you can use by pressing <strong>ESC</strong>, <strong>CTRL</strong>, <strong>ALT</strong> or <strong>META</strong> (<strong>META</strong> is the Windows key on a
regular PC keyboard) followed by regular keys. So the approach is different, but it is widely
accepted that productivity of proficient Emacs users is very high too. Emacs was started in 1985,
and the most popular clone is GNU Emacs. Emacs also features modes, but not in the same sense as vi.
There are major and minor modes.
For instance, if you’re editing a Python script, Emacs will be in Python mode, or if editing a Markdown
file Emacs will be in Markdown mode. This will change the available functions to the user, as well
as provide other niceties, such as auto-completion.
Emacs is also easily extensible, which is another reason why it is so popular.
Users can install packages for Emacs, just like R users would do for R, to extend Emacs’ capabilities.
For instance, a very important package if you plan to use Emacs for statistics or data science is
<code>ESS</code>, <code>E</code>macs <code>S</code>peaks <code>S</code>tatistics. Emacs contains other very high quality packages, and it seems
to me (but don’t quote me on that) that Emacs’ packages are more mature and feature-rich than vi’s
plugins. However, vi keybindings are really awesome. This is, I believe, what
<a href="https://twitter.com/syl20bnr">Sylvain Benner</a> was thinking when he developed Spacemacs.</p>
<p><img src="/img/spacemacs.png" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Spacemacs’ motto is that <em>The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it’s Emacs and Vim!</em>.
Spacemacs is a version, or distribution of Emacs, that has a very specific way of doing things. However,
since it’s built on top of Emacs, all of Emacs’ packages are available to the user, notably <em>Evil</em>,
which is a package that makes Emacs mimick vi’s modal mode and keybindings (the name of this
package tells you everything you need to know about what Emacs users think of vi users 😀)</p>
<p>Not only does Spacemacs support Emacs packages, but Spacemacs also features so-called <em>layers</em>, which
are configuration files that integrate one, or several packages, seamlessly into Spacemacs particular
workflow. This particular workflow is what gave Spacemacs its name.
Instead of relying on <strong>ESC</strong>, <strong>CTRL</strong>, <strong>ALT</strong> or <strong>META</strong> like Emacs, users can launch functions
by typing <strong>Space</strong> in <em>Normal</em> mode and then a sequence of letters. For instance, <strong>Spaceqr</strong> restarts Spacemacs.
And what’s more, you don’t actually need to learn these new key sequences. When you type <strong>Space</strong>,
the minibuffer, a little popup window at the bottom of Spacemacs, appears and shows you all the options
that you can type. For instance, typing <strong>b</strong> after <strong>Space</strong> opens up the buffer menu. Buffers are
what could be called tabs in Rstudio. Here you can chose to <em>delete</em> a buffer, with <strong>d</strong>, create
a new buffer with <strong>N</strong>, and many more options.</p>
<p><img src="/img/minibuffer.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Enough text, let’s get into the videos. But keep in mind the following: the videos below show the
keystrokes I am typing to perform the actions. However, because I use the BÉPO keyboard layout,
which is the french equivalent of the DVORAK layout, the keystrokes will be different than those
in a regular vi guide, which are mainly written for the QWERTY layout.
Also, to use Spacemacs for R, you need to enable the <strong>ESS</strong> layer, which I show how to do at the end.
Enabling this layer will turn on auto-completion, as well as provide documentation in real time
for your function in the minibuffer:</p>
<p><img src="/img/spacemacs_autocompletion.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><img src="/img/spacemacs_doc.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The first video shows Spacemacs divided into two windows. On the left, I am navigating around code
using the <strong>T</strong> (move down) and <strong>S</strong> (move up) keys. To execute a region that I select, I type
<strong>Spacemrr</strong> (this stands for <strong>M</strong>ajor mode <strong>R</strong>un <strong>R</strong>egion). Then around second 5, I key <strong>O</strong>
which switches to <em>Insert</em> mode one line below the line I was, type <code>head(mtcars)</code> and then
<strong>ESC</strong> to switch back to <em>Normal</em> mode and run the line with
<strong>Spacemrl</strong> (<strong>M</strong>ajor mode <strong>R</strong>un <strong>L</strong>ine).</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_01_running_lines.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>In this video, I show you how to switch between windows. Type <strong>SpaceN</strong> to switch to window N. At
the end, I key <strong>dd</strong> which deletes a whole line.</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_02_switching_windows.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>In the video below, I show how to use the pipe operator with <strong>Spacemm</strong>. This is a keyboard shortcut
that I have defined myself. You can also spot the auto-completion at work in this video. To run
the code, I first select it with <strong>V</strong>, which selects the whole line the cursor is currently at
and enters <em>Visual</em> mode. I then select the lines below with <strong>T</strong> and run the region with <strong>Spacemrr</strong>.</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_03_pipe.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>Here I show how plotting behaves. When a plot is created, a new window is opened with the plot. This
is a major shortcoming of using Spacemacs for R programming; there is not a dedicated buffer for
plots, and it only shows the very last one created, so there is no way to keep all the plots created in
the current session in a neat, dedicated buffer. It seems to be possible using
<a href="https://github.com/erikriverson/org-mode-R-tutorial/blob/master/org-mode-R-tutorial.org">Org-mode</a>,
which is an Emacs mode for writing notes, todos, and authoring documents. But I haven’t explored
this option yet, mainly because in my case, only looking at one plot at a time is ok.</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_04_ggplot.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>Here I show how to quickly add text to the top of the document when at the cursor is at the bottom: I try to use
the <code>tabyl()</code> function found in the <code>{janitor}</code> package, which I forgot to load. I quickly go all the
way up with <strong>gg</strong>, then key <strong>yy</strong> to copy the first line, then <strong>P</strong> to paste it on the line below
(<strong>p</strong> would paste it on the same line), type <strong>fv</strong>, to <strong>f</strong>ind the letter v from the word “tidyverse”,
then type <strong>liw</strong> (which is the BÉPO equivalent of <strong>ciw</strong> for <strong>C</strong>hange <strong>I</strong>n <strong>W</strong>ord) and
finally change “tidyverse” to “janitor”. This seems overly complex, but once you get used to this
way of working, you will wonder why you hadn’t tried vi sooner.</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_05_janitor.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>Here I show how to do block comment. <strong>8gg</strong> jumps to the 8th line, <strong>CTRLv</strong> starts block visual
mode, which allows me to select a block of text. I select the first column of the text, <strong>G</strong> to
jump all the way down, then <strong>A</strong> to enter insert mode at the end of the selection (actually, it
would have been more logical to use <strong>I</strong>, which enters insert mode at the beginning of the selection)
of the line and then add “#” to comment.</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_06_block_comment.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>Here I show how to delete a block of text:</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_07_block_delete.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>Search and replace, by entering <em>command-line</em> mode (look at the very bottom of the window):</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_08_search_replace_undo.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>I forgot to add “,” characters on a bunch of lines. I add the first “,” to the first line, go down
and press <strong>ESC</strong> to exit <em>Insert</em> mode. Now in <strong>Normal</strong> mode, I type <strong>.</strong> to execute the last
command, which is <em>inserting a “,” character and going down a line</em>. This <em>dot command</em> is a feature
of vi, and it will always redo the last performed change.</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_09_dot.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>But instead of typing <strong>.</strong> six times, just type <strong>6.</strong> and be done with it:</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_09b_repeated_dot.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>What if you want to do something more complex, involving several commands? Here the <em>dot command</em>
won’t be enough, since it only replicates the last command, not more. For this you
can define macros with **<span class="citation">@*</span>*. I look for the “,” character, twice, and put the rest of the characters
in the next line with enter. I then repeat this operation by executing the macro using <strong>@‌‌a</strong>
repeatedly (<strong>@‌‌a</strong> because I saved the actions in <strong>a</strong>, but it could have been any other letter).
I then undo my changes and execute the macro 5 times with <strong>5@‌‌a</strong>.</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_10_macros.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>Here I show the undo tree (by typing <strong>Spaceua</strong>), which is a feature Spacemacs inherited from
Emacs: it makes undoing changes and going back to a previous version of your script very easily:</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_11_undo_tree.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>Finally, I show my Spacemacs configuration file. I show where one needs to specify the layers one wishes
to use. For R, the ESS layer (which is a configuration file for the ESS Emacs package) is mandatory.
As I explained above, it is also possible to use Emacs packages for which no layer is available.
These are the packages under <code>dotspacemacs-additional-packages</code>. In my case I use:</p>
<pre><code>dotspacemacs-additional-packages &#39;(polymode
                                  poly-R
                                  poly-noweb
                                  poly-markdown)</code></pre>
<p>which makes working with RMarkdown possible. <code>polymode</code> enables simultaneous Major modes, which is
needed for RMarkdown (because RMarkdown files mix Markdown and R).</p>
<div>
<video width="838" height="436" src="/img/spacemacs_12_config.mp4" controls="true" />
</div>
<p>That’s the end of this long post. Spacemacs is really a joy to use, but the learning curve is quite
steep. However, it is definitely worth it. There are so many packages available for Emacs (and hence
Spacemacs) that allow you to browse the web, play games, listen to music, send and read emails…
that a recurrent joke is that Emacs is <em>a very nice operating system, but it lacks
a decent editor</em>. If that’s the case, Spacemacs is the perfect operating system, because it includes
the greatest editor, vi.</p>
<p>If you’re interested and and want to learn more about vi, I advise you to read the following book
<a href="https://www.ossblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/vim-recipes.pdf">Vim Recipes</a> (pdf warning, free)
or <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition">Practical Vim, Edit Text at the Speed of thought</a>
(not free, but worth every cent), and <a href="https://leanpub.com/VimLikeAPro">Use Vim Like a Pro</a>, which
I have not read, but it looks quite good, and is free too if you want. Now this only covers the
vi part, not the Emacs aspects of Spacemacs, but you don’t really need to know about Emacs to
use Spacemacs. I had 0 experience with Emacs, and still have 0 experience with it. I only learned
how to configure Spacemacs, which does not require any previous experience. To find the packages
you need, as usual, use any search engine of your liking.</p>
<p>The last point I want to address is the built-in Vim mode of Rstudio. While it works, it does not
work 100% as regular Vim, and worst of all, does not support, as far as I know, any other keyboard
layout than QWERTY, which is a nogo for me.</p>
<p>In any case, if you’re looking to learn something new that you can use for many programs, including
Rstudio, learn Vim, and then give Spacemacs a try. Chaining keystrokes to edit text gets addictive
very quickly.</p>
